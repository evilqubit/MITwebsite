Furthermore, a website with an online store will be created in order to host my products and a complete online marketing strategy will ensure visibility and increase sales. In the future the company will develop Arabic video games in house and contribute in creating local job opportunities. ","My target audience will be local and regional Arabs from different age group that have access to the internet and would be interested in my products. 49% of the online users in MENA region are under twenty five years of age.
33% of the online users in the MENA region are between 26 and 35 years of age.
The rest of the online users (18%) in the MENA region are over 35 years of age.
It is important to note that the purchasing power is divided between these three groups. We will have a variety in our products that would appeal to large chunk of MENA online users.
","Since the nature of our product will appeal to Arabs, the major geographical target market would be the MENA region. Nevertheless, expatriates all over the globe could purchase our products through an easy 3 step online checkout system. In the beginning it is important to target the GCC countries because they have the largest percentage of purchasing power between all the regional countries. ","according to the internet world stats and the MADAR research, 34 million internet users in the Middle East, 17.5 million users in the GCC-Levant region, with 920% growth from year 2000 to 2007. the size of the market would be at a minimum of 34 million dollars. 
","My competitors in the Middle East would be established video game resellers, video game developers and international distributors. Already a social network base online video game called trivian.ae is being marketed extensively all over the net and is ranking extremely high in terms of visibility and online user registration. As long as the internet penetration is growing in the MENA region, I would expect a equal growth of competitors in the next 5 years.","My product would consist of popular video games that are being dubbed into an Arabic and this alone is a new concept that would be Attractive to my target audience. Furthermore, in order to appeal to a larger audience, i will get popular Arab sports anchors and celebrities to dub the scripts and characters. My products would bring a customized video gaming experience that is totally adapted to an Arab audience.

Soon enough, the company will start by developing video games in house both for consoles and the internet and take the advantage over any competitor that tries to catch on.","I would estimate that the company would break even after 24 months. The budget for the first year would be mainly spent on acquiring the video game licenses, setting up the studio, developing the website and finalizing the product. The second year""s budget would be spent mainly on marketing, distribution creating a sales force and continuing to acquire licenses.   ","I would estimate that the first sale would be made 8-10 months after i start.","The lack of experience is the major risk that is running against me. I plan to be surrounded by experienced advisers and consult some risk management firms. The online purchasing behavior is still not very popular in the Middle East and if the rate does not grow exponentially in the near future it would affect my marketing strategy, therefore, online advertising should not be the soul, instead should be included in the global marketing strategy of the company.

The company will design, integrate and maintain the hardware and software necessary for this link between the business and the consumer.","Target clients focus includes frequent shoppers searching for new products from associated businesses, and individuals with need for a frequent certain product setting, to be quickly realized, maybe automatically, by the associated business. An example for the fist case would be shopping for garments, while for the second case would be buying the usual coffee configuration.
There are no certain age groups or segment of clients initially targeted. The aim is to develop the technology behind the end product and to search for main associates that would drive the application of this technology in different retail segments.","The first associates should be corporate retailers that span on several branches in several cities. This is followed by local retailers in large cities that join with benefits and as the technology proves itself. Focus will be on malls in big cities, with new malls founded rapidly containing several chain businesses.","It is hard to estimate the success of a breakthrough technology. An estimate would be anywhere between 100k USD to 1 million USD, depending on successful business associations.","The technology will compete with online retail, which is practically another approach, usually feared as insecure and not localized within the region.
There are several customer loyalty cards that are occasionally offered for free at stores and subscription cards that allow for discounts at several stores per card. These methods have proven not to be successful and are not interactive, not allowing the experience for the buyer and the customer link with the reseller.","The planned merit found by the end-consumer is the ability to link previous shopping experiences with current ones, and through development of the merchant""s database, be provided with personalized products that can make the shopping experience easier and faster. The merit for the associated businesses is to recieve a ready infrastructure to build databases based on client behaviour, allowing for better product delivery through decreasing human error and facilitating purchase survey. Our final product will retail at a low cost for the consumer, while businesses join the network through lending of hardware and customizable IT infrastructures. This is attainable through utalizing outsourced hardware specifically configured, with low costs, for this concept.","40,000$ for the product development.","40,000$ for the office, salaries, and contracting.","80,000$ to mass advertise the technology .","40,000$ for the store devices.","At least 24 months.

Like wise the tree will grow on. Whenever you get 3 referrals below you on each side you get US$250. This network will grow on. The only thing you have to do is refer as many people as possible. For the Investment you make you will get some product.
You have to be 18 years + to join. You invest only small amount of money and earn more. I know people who earn US$5000 per month. You can join only if anyone refers you. You can check other members who join under you through online. If you want anyone to join under you, you can make them join seeing your tree level.

We are planning to open offices and retails in all the GCC countries.","The ICONIC concept consists of nurturing the creativity of our young Arab designers and opens for them the doors to realize their dreams and be able to show to the world that we have talented Arab designers and we will create the new trends of tomorrow in a very fashionable way thus conveying and transferring to all the world our culture and our potential in a very beautiful and peaceful way thus we are going to enable those designers in a very intelligent and efficient way to face to the competition of the huge fast fashion mass products that doesnâ€™t take into consideration the preferences nor the cultural fingerprint of the people in each countries. Today all the Arab designers will have the opportunity to create a piece of art a fashion item ( such as cloth or an accessories in one or more categories: handbags, accessories, wardrobe, Ready-to-wear, Jewels),then all those designs will be posted on the ICONIC website which will be marketed through creating a viral marketing campaign thus saving money that will be invested more efficiently in other area, where the customers will enter the website and vote to the best designers and rank the products. The top products that receive the highest score will be manufactured and sold at the ICONIC  website and unique stores where the customers will find the most exclusive and fashionable products that meets best theirs tastes in a great environment where they will have the chance to meet the designers of their cloths in the shop where there will be an open space where some designers will always be present and working (designing, drawing, cuttingâ€¦)thus the customers will see the world of the designers. In addition to we should mention that we are using the internet voting in order to be able to collect information of our customers thus targeting them better, and we should not forget the amount of Publicity we will receive as well the word of mouth marketing that will be created through this competition where each designer will tell his friend about the conceptâ€¦","As a beginning our stores will target women that are between the age of 18 and 35 years that have an acceptable purchasing power and are willing to pay on average 35% higher than they would pay for at the usual fast fashion shops such as Vero Moda or H&M. Our target market at this age will be probably working and having additional income and usually is ready to spent larger amount of money for shopping, moreover during this age women are open to change and are ready to try something new , they need to looks unique and up-to-date not only wearing like everyone the low quality products that today are almost the same in all the stores , those products that doesn""t take in consideration a lot the taste diffrence between Occident. and the Arab countries.We choose to position ourselves in the mind of the customer as delivering better Quality as well Unique and Fashionable clothes that will fit the best its taste at every moment and occasions. ","My ICONIC concept was born when we were able to see a Real need and an underserved market which is very large thus we would be operating at a very efficient way in the short and long term.

After sensing this need we used more scientific approach to be able to make sure that what we saw is real and there is a real opportunity, thatâ€™s why we did for long time research studies and used proper marketing research tools such as survey (more than 311 people filled our survey, we did interviews with 87 people to be able to know and understand their purchasing behavior and what they believe is missed in this industry and asked them what we could to fulfill their needs and improve the way they shop, and used some observational research to validate our previous results).","based on our estimation of the size of the market: 
200,000 women including tourists , spent around 250$ per year on average at the products in similar category . the size of the market in dollar term will be around:50,000,000$

(this is the estimation based on the market than we reach from our first stores and internet sales. It is very important to note that the market is larger especially if we will expand to the arab countries as we plan to do .)","We expect that in year 3 we will be established and having an efficient production and marketing unit, and by then we would be able to solve all our logistics problem that we faced in the first two year such as delivering the right item at the right time for all the GCC countries and by then we would be able to solve all the pending legal issues that normally arise when exporting to new countries and by then as well will have an efficient distribution system by working with sub agent, as well we would be able to sell for all the GCC countries through our website and POS,our sales at Year 3 will be around 1,200,000$ those sales are generated on average by 12,000 persons that spent on average 100$ each year. Those figures are conservative and based on our marketing research which could be higher or lower depending on different factors which we will be more than happy to discuss it with you upon your request. Please not that our sales will raise exponentially with around 100% when we enter U.A.E. at year 3. The profit margin is high in this industry we expect to have aprofit margin of 18% which 216,000$. which will be around 500,000 after 1,2 year we enter U.A.E. and around another 100 % (of the 500,000$) after 1,2 year we enter K.S.A. so in year 6 we will have profit of 1,000,000 $ taking into consideration our starting financial resources, however by year 5 we would have this high production capacity.","The Start-up cost are the cost of the website which is 5,000 and the marketing cost 10,000(which is low since we are concentration on Publicity) the other 35,000 will be invested in production and inventory cost which at first will be handeled by a third party in order to avoid high investing cost in production. We need 25,000 to pay for the decoration of our retail and we need another 15,000 as working capitalto pay for employee and other expense till we strt generating cash flow and profit. The rent will be paid at the end of the first year which will be paid from our profit.

Total Fund needed is around 90,000$
","A very important things in this project is the cost structure that decrease significalty the risk take. Since we are going to cooperate with manufacturer to manufacture our products at the beging we wonâ€™t have to invest a lot of money. Our Fixed cost will be around 98,500$which includes : Retail rent,legal costs,decoration, equipement , accessories to disply the merchandise.As well the website development.","The main competitors are the fast fashion companies such as Zara and H&M which sell mass products which are affordable however we are planning to deliver better quality products at a reasonable price and to sell the customer products that fits well his taste as well sell them an experience thus letting them appreciate the high value they are receiving. We want to position ourselves as providing good quality products that are fashionable and affordable at the same time which they wonâ€™t find elsewhere that fits their tastes.","The marketing expenses will be low since we are going to focus to create a buzz marketing . As well we want to create trend to this new concpet a certain style life and thus we will be able to do that through the tools that will reach our target the best as well that are not very costly, such as Facebook and twitter, Fashion Magazine, Radio, Website and advertisement, competition and events ( such as a small fashion show). we estimate our marketing expense to be around 155,500$","90,000 $ (sales values: 395,000$) on average we will try to keep as much as possible low by having just-in time invetory and to be able to be flexible by repsonding to any changes in tastes of the market.","Since we will be the first to manage all those talents and to join them in one place by creating this first time concept and experience this will make us to win a big loyalty from our customers and to defend very well our positions in the market because we will be the refrence of this concept. We will build high brand loyalty as well we will maitain a good relation with all our designers .Moreover we will try to have contract with the best designer for several years as well we will give those designer what they deserve and this will attract all the good designers to work with us. In addition to that we will have in place all the logisitcs. All those factors will make it difficult for new entrants for at least the couple years to comes. Once any new entrants will try to enter the market he will be perceived as copying our concepts.","Briefly I can say that we are providing good quality products that are fashionable and affordable at the same time which they wonâ€™t find elsewhere and it fits their tastes. In addition to that they live an amazing experience while buying the products and will have an emotional attachment to the product which they know the designer of it.","Briefly I can say that we are providing good quality products that are fashionable and affordable at the same time which they wonâ€™t find elsewhere and it fits their tastes.

In addition to that we are taking into consideration the cost to enter the new market and the difficulties to enter them.

The project will be fully equipped with environmental facilities (Treatment Plant Wastewater, solar panels, gas water heater and only the steam room will be heated with wood).
For restoration, we expect that building a hostel for cooking day dishes is the most user friendly way of participatory spirit, collecting and cooking own farm fruits and vegetables.

The concept is thoroughly distinguished, reflecting a sole new experience in the Art of purchasing.
How many times have we not been able to spot our needs when shopping for ourselves or our beloved ones? How many times have we sought objective assistance in terms of determining what convenes us most without receiving any accurate input? Moreover, how many times have we fantasized about the joy of a prestigious Shopping experience without going wild with our spending habits?",,"Initiated a low budget Market Study, that was human resourced and strategically driven and that didn""t require professionals in order to cut terms on budget. The study consisted of identifying dissected areas that are targeted for our product positioning, and discerning the nature of the market in terms of the Brands exposed in that area, the pricing affiliated to them, the social nature of the targeted audience. It also included the spending habits of the customers in that area, projecting potential income generated in that market, detecting marketing activities that future rivals are engaged in, and the market share of each of the competitors with the accorded SWOT analysis.",,,,,,,,,"Outsourced collection of apparels and accessories of the most updated fashion in the world, targeting young and middle age adults. It encompasses Chic, Casual and Sports Chic assortments.  
For that to happen in a continuous competitive advantage:
â€¢	Conduct weekly researches Online and in the local market (stores, magazines, fashion shows etcâ€¦) after spotting the nucleus source of fashion generators. These researches should be assessed on specific criteria and reported thoroughly to the purchasing manager. It is crucial to keep track of all updates of Fashion. (Seasonâ€™s trends, colors, pricing portfolio, prospects feedback etcâ€¦)  This will represent the Marketing intelligence, one of the most vital and affective sections of the decision-making process. It should be handled by experienced professionals with an insight on the companyâ€™s overall mission.

â€¢	Spot exclusive sources of high quality wears for modest pricing. Finishing is the most important criteria with the source designation, that is, after granting the quality elegance and effectiveness.
Potential sources could be locally, Europe (Italy, Turkey, and France) and Far East.
To settle with exclusive suppliers and initiate a long term relationship with them, testing of the material and their work should be very accurate and basic based on sampling and mini orders; it should include testing areas such as: 
-Quality		-Finishing	-Time commitment	-Costing	         -Honesty

With its built-in business advisor, eldaftar can help SMBs owners in understanding the consequences of their management decisions in addition to enabling them to manage their business more effectively and profitably. In addition to eldaftar available vertical solutions, eldaftar could be branded and integrated with other readymade business partners solutions (Vodafone Egypt â€œelmodeerâ€ business case).

",,,,,,,,,"First production year should be highly dedicated to software development. Entry barrier is not high which poses a continuous threat that needs to be addressed continuously through tremendous efforts to keep the product on the top. lots of effort should be done to deliver innovative application add-ons, new features and focus on customer stickiness specially in the first six months of customer adoption.","The value proposition is to deliver reliable cloud-based IT solutions for SMB at an affordable cost with no infrastructure requirements. The challenge for SMBs to advance from an IT perspective is to start acquiring the needed infrastructure such as servers, network and needed applications. Seeking international solutions doesnâ€™t help because of the language barrier as well as the local culture needs from different perspectives such as accounting standards (examples competing are quicken and Peachtree). eldaftar and potential new nhanc offerings will dramatically reduce the cost, headache and effort to run a reliable IT solution for this market.",,,"nhanc will focus on three primary markets during 2011-2012. These markets are Egypt, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. As the initial local market, the SMB market size in Egypt is not officially quantified due to varying data from different government sources.. The unofficial forecasts are in the range of 500,000 SMBs in major cities. The Egyptian ICT indicators portal indicates that business including SMBs who are using the internet reached 35% by July 2009. Sub segmentation of the SMBs in each market is another needed step to help in positioning eldaftar correctly. These sub-segments are expected to be small (0-25 employees), medium (26-50 employees) and large (51-99 employees). Each of these will require a significant level of variation on the online platform and a smooth transition from one step to the other in catering the exponential growth of any successful SMB.",,,"nhanc is promoting eldaftar using a selective distribution channel model to achieve its goal of generating profitable and sustainable revenue stream. This model could be classified into two types according to the target segment:-

1)For SME, the business model for the platform
â€¢	Long term monthly subscription fees 
â€¢	Platform add-ons as major revenue stream

2)For Large enterprise, the business model for the platform
â€¢	Advertising to eldaftar SME customers as a revenue source
â€¢	Eldaftar extension agreements (Distribution and Order Management) ex. Unilever, P&G
â€¢	Analytics reporting revenue",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,,,7

Many people that ive met through all these years have shown a great deal of interest in the taste these nuts have and i believe opening a store under the real name which is ""Tavazo Nuts"" would really grab peoples attention as well as showing the Iranian culture in decorating the shop so it would be a diverse idea towards peoples eyes such as europeans, Arabs, americans, ect...

",,,,,"Tavazo is known between the iranian community, UAE nationals are big fans of iranian nuts, whats keeping Tavazo ahead of its competitors, is tha fact that every Iranian knows about this product, so once it shows itself here as another brach in UAE, it attracts the customers to itself.

We propose to contract with government entities such as the utility company and the traffic patrol office to set up an online service for citizens to pay their utility bills and parking tickets.  This would be a major convenience for the citizens, and it would be very cost effective for the government as the online platform would cut the costs typical in a brick and mortar operation (rent, utilities, labor, etc).",,"We have spoken to many Jordanians who agree that it is much simpler and more effective to log on to the internet and pay a bill than it is to drive to a local office and wait in line, only to do the same.  We have studied the market in the United States where similar services exist.  Most importantly, we are in discussions with executives at the incumbent Jordan utility regarding the possibility of offering this service.",,"Market growth is best estimated by nominal GDP growth, which is roughly 3.2%.  This number is further compounded by the dramatic increase in internet penetration (it more than doubled from 2007 to 2009 and is expected to reach 50% by the end of 2011).","Through discussion with various software developers, as well as our knowledge of programming, server maintenance, and hosting from previous work on internet businesses, we estimate the costs as follows:

Programming costs: $37,500; we reach this number by multiplying 500 hours of programming, testing, security testing, etc. by the $75 rate we would pay for top of the market programmers

Server fees: $1,000 a month for a dedicated server whereby 99.99% uptime is guaranteed.

Marketing expense: $20,000; because incentives are aligned with the government in that costs are reduced when citizens pay their bills online, the utility and traffic authority will promote the service.  This alleviates our marketing expense, but test campaigns could be beneficial.
",,"The greatest potential competitor would be the government itself if it chose to operate the online service on its own as opposed to outsource it. It would not be in the interest of the government to do so given the cost savings and efficiency of outsourcing information technology (IT) processes.",,,,"The competitive advantage will be maintained only by cooperation with the government to be the incumbent supplier of this online service.  Otherwise, barriers to entry are low and other companies can offer their own software at a lower commission for citizens to pay their bills.  Only by partnering with local governments and being regarded as the dominant, incumbent supplier will success build upon success and prevent entry of competition.","The competitor, or status quo of going somewhere to make a payment, is inefficient, inconvenient, and outdated.  Secure online payments will transform several bothersome errands into a few clicks.","The electrical company, government, and other organizations receiving payments may eliminate the middle man (us) and offer secure online payment services directly to the customer.  By creating a single portal for all payments, however, we reduce this risk.",,"The target country is initially Jordan, a country in which we were born and have knowledge of local customs as well as relationships with people in various industries.  The business has ability to expand, but unbridled growth will be detrimental.  Instead, we wish to focus in Jordan first, and become the dominant (hopefully only) service supplier to the government, thus creating barriers to entry for competitors.

Our target customers are the population of Jordan that receives an electricity bill or parking ticket and has easy access to the internet. Currently, internet penetration is over 36% and rapidly rising.
","Thanks for your consideration!","For the electrical bill component:
Population of Jordan: 6 million people
Households in Jordan: ~1 million
Internet users: 1,741,000
Internet penetration: 36%
People paying bills each month: 360,000
Average bill: $60 dollars
Total yearly bill payment: 360,000 * $60 * 12 months = $259,200,000
Commission (2%): 2% of $259,200,000 = $5,184,000","We will earn a commission of 2% or so from each transaction.  We are in the process of calculating the total costs for the government to offer a standard bricks and mortar operation with desk attendants to serve the population.  Because this business is only viable if the government a) chooses to allow an online platform and b) chooses to have it outsourced, the price (i.e., our commission) must be lower than its current cost to serve the community.",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,"It is a mainstay of Jordanian life to head to a government office, a post office, or bank each month to pay the electricity bill.  It is also a fact of life that any parking or traffic violation must be resolved in person.  Our service would simplify this process as citizens would be afforded the opportunity to pay their bills or tickets online.

The convenience to the citizenry is obvious, and so is the cost effectiveness to the government.  An online portal could eliminate many jobs where government employees serve the long lines of people waiting to pay a bill.  Instead, these employees can be moved to other jobs in other areas of the economy where they can potentially have a higher productivity.  Of course the cost to the government would be a fraction of the value of each transaction.  But the savings would exceed the cost: one study in the United States valued the cost of processing an online transaction at a mere $1.60 as opposed to the $6.60 it cost for a counter transaction.  Instead of paying rent, electricity, labor, etc., the government would instead pay a fraction of each transaction.  Furthermore, in addition to reducing costs, this service has the potential to increase government revenues, as many people simply do not pay parking tickets due to the time and hassle associated with doing so.","When the website is fully operational, citizens will utilize the service as soon as they learn about it.  Few people would prefer to take a drive to pay a bill rather than go online and pay it in a few easy clicks.",7

Musharka Mutanaqessa) and the crowdfunding model. Therefore, it is based, from one hand, on  sharing profits and losses between Istedbaaâ€™s investment fund and the matched project. On another hand, it does not offer any returns on investment (ROI) except for the â€œcrowdâ€ who will get the product they crowdfunded . Of course the donors will not have any tangible ROI except the recognition of their sadaka. 

Therefore, our 3 main groups of clients (MSEs, product developers and the crowd) will only pay for results, and the fundamental upgrade in productivity and innovation due to Istebdaa"" services.

Istebdaaâ€™ will invest in the â€œmatchedâ€ projects with a maximum amount of 30.000 EGP, and up to 50% of the total costs involved in the operation. In other words, after that Istebdaaâ€™ links the demand with the supply of innovation/ideas/product design it will invest in these latter as long as the total capital needed does not exceed 60.000 EGP.
The rest of the capital for each â€œmatchedâ€ projects will be shared between the firm, product designer and/or online community crowdunding (consumers or donors). The fund will go to the project itself as an independent legal entity, neither to the firm nor to the product developers solely. This will insure an additional mutual risk management, takaful. 

Every repayment of capital by the entrepreneur will diminish the total capital ratio for Istebdaaâ€™ in the project, as well as profit shares. Profits from each project are shared between stakeholders (including Istebdaaâ€™) and the firm gradually buys Istebdaaâ€™s shares in the project and share them with the designers till they both own 100% of the project within a predetermined timeline. As for the e-Sadaka and e-consumersâ€™ contributions, they will be considered as part of the MSEâ€™ shares. Any Sadaka issuer will be able to track the multiplication of his Sadaka in different projects.

The repayment period is dependent upon the pre-agreed period. It should be suitable till the development of the product (grace period till the commercialization).
An example: A Fanous Made by Egyptians
Workshops in Hussein and elsewhere, who are facing an aggressive Chinese competition through the last decade, need to innovate and upgrade the value chain for their fawanees by a cost-effective mean. Istebdaa"" team will try to bring on the technical difficulties faced by those workshops and will look for solvers. 
Young innovators who might have funny and bright ideas for new forms of Fawanees. They can help workshops in adding some new functions in the products or a new production process for a better quality/price ratio. For instance, adding a new functionality to let it be useful even after the holy month ends.
As mentioned, our innovation system should be more demand-driven and based on the potential marketability and how to increase it. Therefore, Egyptian children must have a say and also contribute in the evolution of the Fanous. Throughout the portal, children and other internet-users will post ideas and suggestions for their Fanous. Through Crowdfunding, children""s parents will have the option to: (i) pay 10 LE as an e-Sadaka, (ii) pay 60 LE buy in advance the innovative fanous, and (iii) pay 120 LE and get a personalized fannous!
In addition, a contest could be organized in different regions of Egypt to let children draw the way they want their Fanous, and choosing among them the best designs.

Finally, the Fanous is the simplest example of how could we improve our economy by â€œinjectingâ€ more â€œknowledgeâ€ into it. The comeback of the Egyptian Fanous is only the beginning for a brighter future of our economy.
",,,,,,,,1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,"The Arab region is witnessing historical moments of change and hope; these youth-led movements are a clear illustration of what the synergy between youth and knowledge could do, from the one hand. Meanwhile, it has shown what societal risks can unemployment and hopelessness provoke. 
The current political change in Egypt would surely have many economic implications. The main economic challenges are, among others: (1) Fighting skilled youth unemployment , (2) Increasing the Egyptian workforce productivity  and (2) Upgrading the value-added and the marketability of the Egyptian products .
This needs an intermediation framework that matches the local societal needs, local knowledge with local and/or international markets. The main problem that is preventing any these factors from being matched was (1) the financial burden and more specifically the refusal of commercial banks to support such initiatives without any collateral, (2) the unclear perception of the innovative ideas demand & supply.

The global dental equipment and consumables market is estimated to be $27.6 billion by 2015, growing at a CAGR of
7%. The market is expected to grow because of the tremendous demand for dental biomaterial and dental implants. It
is expected that the market for dental implants and dental biomaterials will grow at an overall CAGR of 6% and
10.5% respectively from 2010 â€“ 2015.

sensitive to prices rather than quality or high technology, but this trend is changing towards a major attention for
reliable equipment and quality products.

Currently In Egypt, our expected customer dentist makes a 3D casted plaster frame about 2 or three times daily, and
each of these frames pay from LE 100 to 800 for each according to the plaster material and according to the part of
the jaw required to be made. And they also pays from LE 2000 to 5000 for a 3D modeling software with too much

","Our system takes some advantages over the competitors:
1. Efficiency: error is about 2-3 micrometer over manual plaster frames because of the hand-made errors and the normalization shrinkage factor of approximately 2-3 millimeter, less production cost in terms of money and time

",,"The global dental equipment and consumables market is estimated to be $27.6 billion by 2015.

The dental market size in Egypt is estimated at $50 million, in 2007.
","â€¢ Size
The global dental equipment and consumables market is estimated to be $27.6 billion by 2015, growing at a CAGR of
7%. The market is expected to grow because of the tremendous demand for dental biomaterial and dental implants. It
is expected that the market for dental implants and dental biomaterials will grow at an overall CAGR of 6% and
10.5% respectively from 2010 â€“ 2015.
The dental market size in Egypt is estimated at $50 million, in 2007. Traditionally, the Egyptian market is very
sensitive to prices rather than quality or high technology, but this trend is changing towards a major attention for
reliable equipment and quality products.
",,"*Direct Competitors: starting from 2009, there are 3 expensive devices ios3d, iTero and Lava, produced by 3 American companies but they have no agents in Egypt or in Middle East.

*Indiret Competitors: Several hundreds of dental labs that""ll produce the 3D hand-held models for the jaws and teeth manually with lack of accuracy and high cost in terms of money and effort",,,,"â€¢ Revenue Streams
Currently In Egypt, our expected customer dentist makes a 3D casted plaster frame about 2 or three times daily, and
each of these frames pay from LE 100 to 800 for each according to the plaster material and according to the part of
the jaw required to be made. And they also pays from LE 2000 to 5000 for a 3D modeling software with too much
features called â€œDolphinâ€ plus annual renewal fees from LE 500 to 1200.
The day we finish our first successful prototype, we start targeting the dental students in the Egyptian faculties with
our first by-products with special offers to build audience and try to get income cash flow so early. As we cover our
expenses and costs for, we""ll offer special invitations to access our services to special, highly-selected expected
customers then later through dental conferences start targeting medium class dentists then low class dentists with
special offers to their needs. In parallel to this, we""ll be building the supporting DICOM images viewer and 3D
modeling tool as prepaid web service on iPad and Android if needed.
","Our system takes some advantages over the competitors:
1. Efficiency: error is about 2-3 micrometer over manual plaster frames because of the hand-made errors and the normalization shrinkage factor of approximately 2-3 millimeter, less production cost in terms of money and time

2. It enables our customers using our system without buying expensive devices as our direct competitors through a prepaid web service (for getting the input medical images files and processing the 3D modeling) and delivery service (for the printed models) equivalent to our system.

3. We enable our customer integrating their iProducts (iPhone, iPad) and their Android to facilitate their interfacing our system and our services by developing iOS and Android clients.
","â€¢ Cost Structure
We are planning to reduce the cost as possible without sacrificing the quality as possible by depending on Hi-Tech
solutions like virtual offices, cloud computing back-end and so on. The most expensive key resources is the 3d
printers, and the most expensive key activities is the software development for the DICOM viewer and the 3D
modeler


Phase0: Construction= 1 month; Virtual office and infrastructure
Phase1: Prototyping = 3 to 4 months; first side product and the first income cash flow
Phase2: Beta = 15 to 20 months; more side-products and the occurrence of break-even point and the payback will be
near the end of this phase.
Phase3: Production = more; building the production line

We need about $15,000 to start prototyping and we can afford 15% of this cost currently",,"We""ll have 2 positive impacts on the community: The first is the efficiency; 
We target the effeciency of the professional life of our customers and save their resources; effort, time and money. The second is the environmental impact;

This new product is made of a spherical sun receiver linked with a wind mill.  The Ballerina follows the sun for maximum efficiency.  It also has a dual flexible receiver that switches between a concentrated PV receiver or a hot black plate for water heating.  The windmill is located below the spherical receiver and is independent of the above system. The Ballerina base provides the brain of the system and has all the necessary controls namely: two large liquid reservoirs for hot and or/cold water storage.  A large set of batteries used to store electricity from the wind turbine and from the PV concentrated panel.  The base has also the inverter, and necessary pumps along with a general controller that would be linked to the household user showing him or her in real time how much the system is producing electricity and heat (hot/cold) and the amount of energy produced and stored.  The system can also communicate with other Ballerina""s and share energies (i.e. if one user of a house does not use all his electricity needs and has an excess), he or she can transfer this energy to another Ballerina, hence not only the optimization is on a micro-user but it could be expended to a community of users.  The name ""Ballerina"" was used to reflect its gracious sun tracking and simultaneous wind rotation with its flexibility to manage energy.
This product is a complete, efficient and smart renewable energy system that works during day and night.  It also combines heat storage and cold storage that could be done during the night using stored electrical energy or from wind.  The Ballerina controller decides when to produce heat/cold or when to produce electricity.  On a windy and cloudy day, the Ballerina may stop tracking the sun and position itself vertically for maximum wind energy production.  It""s built in anemometer and sun energy sensors, along with the existing energy storage system and user history would allow the Ballerina to decide how best to optimize the system for maximum energy supply.  The Ballerina is needed as it fills a need for consumers that are still undecided on what to purchase to cut down their energy needs.  Consumers are struggling whether to buy a Solar Water Heater or a stand alone PV panel system or Wind System.  Now they have the option to buy one system that optimizes all three.  The consumer does not have to worry anymore on what to buy as the Ballerina satisfies all his or her energy needs in a practical and simple way.

This new product is made of a spherical sun receiver linked with a wind mill.  The Ballerina follows the sun for maximum efficiency.

The windmill is located below the spherical receiver and is independent of the above system.

A large set of batteries used to store electricity from the wind turbine and from the PV concentrated panel.  The base has also the inverter, and necessary pumps along with a general controller that would be linked to the household user showing him or her in real time how much the system is producing electricity and heat (hot/cold) and the amount of energy produced and stored.  The system can also communicate with other Ballerina""s and share energies (i.e. if one user of a house does not use all his electricity needs and has an excess), he or she can transfer this energy to another Ballerina, hence not only the optimization is on a micro-user but it could be expended to a community of users.  The name ""Ballerina"" was used to reflect its gracious sun tracking and simultaneous wind rotation with its flexibility to manage energy.
This product is a complete, efficient and smart renewable energy system that works during day and night.  It also combines heat storage and cold storage that could be done during the night using stored electrical energy or from wind.  The Ballerina controller decides when to produce heat/cold or when to produce electricity.  On a windy and cloudy day, the Ballerina may stop tracking the sun and position itself vertically for maximum wind energy production.  It""s built in anemometer and sun energy sensors, along with the existing energy storage system and user history would allow the Ballerina to decide how best to optimize the system for maximum energy supply.  The Ballerina is needed as it fills a need for consumers that are still undecided on what to purchase to cut down their energy needs.  Consumers are struggling whether to buy a Solar Water Heater or a stand alone PV panel system or Wind System.  Now they have the option to buy one system that optimizes all three.  The consumer does not have to worry anymore on what to buy as the Ballerina satisfies all his or her energy needs in a practical and simple way.

On travaille essentiellement avec Amazona Web Service, Microsoft Azure et Google AppEngine ce qui permet dâ€™offrir Ã  nos clients un large Ã©ventail des constructeurs et de ne pas les limiter Ã  une seule offre, en plus, on peut intervenir depuis la phase de dÃ©veloppement jusquâ€™Ã  installation et dÃ©ploiement au niveau du Cloud et puis le support Client de sorte que lâ€™utilisateur final nâ€™aura pas aucun souci sur les problÃ¨mes dâ€™installation et configuration.
La majoritÃ© de nos concurrents qui offrent de lâ€™Outsourcing  ne font en rÃ©alitÃ© que lâ€™Outsourcing de quelques piÃ¨ces de la fonction IT ou peut Ãªtre certains produits. Contrairement Ã  lâ€™offre de notre sociÃ©tÃ©, on combine entre les meilleurs approches du Cloud Computing et Software as Service qui permettent de livrer et supporter une rangÃ©e importante des produits et des services.

Nous sommes fiers au sein de Â« Reliance TunisieÂ» de notre plateforme ouverte, extensible  et non propriÃ©taire face Ã  nos clients (gouvernements, opÃ©rateurs, entreprises, organismes, etc.), une approche qui leur permet de mÃ©langer, mixer et choisir les services correspondants Ã  leurs besoins et aux spÃ©cifications de leur business.

â€¢	Rendre l""imitation difficile (par la complexitÃ©, l""ambiguÃ¯tÃ© ou l""encastrement dans la culture) ou les ressources intransfÃ©rables ;
â€¢	RÃ©investir les marges pour assurer la diffÃ©renciation (stratÃ©gie dite hybride) ;

","Notre sociÃ©tÃ© possÃ¨de un business model  flexible, nos solutions ne demandent  pas au dÃ©but un coÃ»t fixÃ© trÃ¨s chÃ¨re, la majoritÃ© de nos dÃ©penses viennent aprÃ¨s que le client signe son contrat, nos produits sont en gÃ©nÃ©ral exposÃ©s sous forme des services  basÃ©s sur des standards ouverts pour les rendre accessible au plus grand nombre des clients (Tablette, TÃ©lÃ©phone, PC  et mÃªme des clients tiers). 

On prend aussi dÃ¨s le dÃ©part de la conception de lâ€™architecture de nos produits la possibilitÃ© de les intÃ©grer  dans les solutions de nos partenaires, par exemple, un service autour de lâ€™environnement est vendu par transaction/ par opÃ©rateur.

",,"Lâ€™activitÃ© de recherche et dÃ©veloppement de notre sociÃ©tÃ© Â« Reliance Tunisie Â» concentre sur deux domaines : lâ€™Ã©ducation et la protection de lâ€™environnement, en effet les principales objectifs de notre solution est :

1)	Proposer une plateforme web Â« RÃ©volution OS Â»  Ã©quivalente Ã  un systÃ¨me dâ€™exploitation classique mais qui est accessible avec le web et Ã  travers une variÃ©tÃ© des pÃ©riphÃ©riques (tablettes, navigateurs, ordinateurs et mÃªme un tÃ©lÃ©phone portable).

2)	Les Ã©coles et les universitÃ©s ne sont pas obligÃ©es Ã  payer les licences pour chaque ordinateur et pour chaque application et pour chaque systÃ¨me installÃ© comme la cas de Windows mais plutÃ´t, elles vont accÃ©der au service par une application standard facilement disponible, la plupart du temps un navigateur Web et la facturation se fait  uniquement lorsque il y a une utilisation et pas tout le temps  (câ€™est le modÃ¨le Cloud Computing) ce qui aboutit Ã  un gain financier trÃ¨s grand pour les gouvernements africaines.

3)	Lâ€™hÃ©bergement de la solution Â« RÃ©volution OS Â» sera dans le Cloud, ce qui rÃ©duit considÃ©rablement lâ€™Ã©nergie utilisÃ© dans lâ€™entreprise et les organismes publiques et par suite rÃ©duit lâ€™Ã©mission de CO2 et les gaz Ã  effet de serre parce ce que toute lâ€™infrastructure (serveurs, services, logiciels et hardware) sera du ressort d""un fournisseur expÃ©rimentÃ© comme  Â« Tunisie TelecomÂ», ou Â« Google Â», ou Â« Amazona Â» qui offrent un niveau rigoureux de la sÃ©curitÃ© et la fiabilitÃ© dâ€™infrastructure.


4)	Cette plateforme regroupe dans un seul endroit toutes les applications mÃ©tiers des universitÃ©s, Ã©coles et entreprises (Ã©diteur de texte pour la rÃ©daction, indexation et stockage des fichiers, vidÃ©o confÃ©rence,  gestion Ã©tudiants, gestion clients, marketing, office, collaboration, communication,  etc.)

5)	Les utilisateurs (les universitÃ©s et les Ã©coles) ne sont plus gÃ©rant de leurs serveurs informatiques mais peuvent accÃ©der de maniÃ¨re Ã©volutive Ã  de nombreux services en ligne sans avoir Ã  gÃ©rer l""infrastructure sous-jacente, souvent complexe, et câ€™est ce quâ€™on appelle lâ€™informatique dÃ©matÃ©rialisÃ© moderne (Cloud Computing).

On veut ajouter des informations concernant la partie Recherche et dÃ©veloppement et les normes appliquÃ©s au sein de notre entreprise Â« Reliance Tunisie Â» :

ï¶	Recherche & dÃ©veloppement : Â« Reliance Tunisie Â» cherche Ã  sâ€™intÃ©grer avec les Ã©coles et les universitÃ©s pour renforcer son activitÃ© de rechercher et dÃ©veloppement.

ï¶	Normes environnementales : Â« Reliance Tunisie Â» va suivre les bons pratiques liÃ©s Ã  lâ€™aspect Ã©cologie, On envisage dans un future proche passer la certification ISO 14001 de lâ€™environnement.

","Â« Reliance Tunisie Â» va se concentrer exclusivement sur le Cloud Computing et le Â« Software as a service Â» ce qui permet de fournir accÃ¨s Ã  nos produits et solutions Ã  travers un espace de travail virtuel dÃ©matÃ©rialisÃ©. Notre marchÃ© cible va prioriser les opÃ©rateurs tÃ©lÃ©phonique, les fournisseurs de santÃ© public et privÃ©e, le domaine gouvernementale notamment comme lâ€™open Government et lâ€™Open Data  et bien sur le domaine de lâ€™Ã©ducation et la protection de lâ€™environnement.","Le secteur des Logiciels et Services doit jouer un rÃ´le majeur pour mesurer la performance de dÃ©veloppement durable, environnementale en particulier, mÃªme un bureau dâ€™Ã©tude possÃ¨de des impacts nÃ©gatifs sur lâ€™environnement, a quoi bon parler des organismes, Ã©coles et des universitÃ©s africaines qui utilisent une infrastructure informatique et logistique importante (ordinateurs, serveurs, applications, licences des produits, utilisateurs, etc.).

Cette infrastructure traditionnelle est toujours trop compliquÃ©e et onÃ©reuse et surtout trÃ¨s chÃ¨re, je cite Ã  titre dâ€™exemple le contrat fait par lâ€™ancien gouvernement tunisien et Microsoft, 5 ans de licence dâ€™utilisation de Windows dans les universitÃ©s et les Ã©coles pour 20 millions de dinars ! Aussi le contrat fait par Tunisie Telecom et Microsoft, un Million de dinar pour uniquement une licence de 600 utilisateurs, sans prendre en compte les prix de licence des autres produits. 

Donc Ã  quoi bon de parler des pays africaines les plus pauvres parce ce que ces pays ont besoin de faire un progrÃ¨s dans le domaine de lâ€™Ã©ducation et la protection de lâ€™environnement sans perdre beaucoup dâ€™argent, ils ont besoin aussi dâ€™offrir Ã  leur peuple une infrastructure informatique moderne, Ã©cologique, indÃ©pendante des grands constructeurs informatique et aussi avec bas prix.

Donc, En tenant compte des problÃ¨mes de lâ€™Ã©ducation et la pollution dans certaines pays africaines et en partant de tous ses problÃ¨mes liÃ©s Ã  lâ€™Ã©cologie et la protection de lâ€™environnement et la rÃ©duction des coÃ»ts dans les Ã©coles et les universitÃ©s dâ€™Afrique, on prÃ©sente lâ€™idÃ©e dâ€™un systÃ¨me dâ€™exploitation web, Ã©cologique en ligne nommÃ© Â« RÃ©volution OS Â».

Lâ€™intÃ©rÃªt de la solution Â« RÃ©volution OS Â» dÃ©passe le cadre de la crÃ©ation dâ€™une simple application Web ou dâ€™un systÃ¨me d""exploitation proposÃ© Ã  distance (ce quâ€™on appelle virtualisation) mais plutÃ´t lâ€™intÃ©rÃªt est de concevoir un nouveau concept dâ€™applications Ã©cologiques centralisÃ©es accessibles nâ€™importe oÃ¹ et nâ€™importe comment Ã  travers un navigateur classique ou un simple tÃ©lÃ©phone portable contrairement aux systÃ¨mes dâ€™exploitations classiques actuel.

Ce types dâ€™applications fournissent les fonctionnalitÃ©s basiques pour les utilisateurs (suite bureautique, outils de collaboration, navigation, stockage des fichiers, etc.), elles ne nÃ©cessitent pas une licence dâ€™achat ! (le bonheur pour les gouvernements africaines) et elles sont extensibles, c""est-Ã -dire, on peut installer dâ€™autres applications dedans comme sâ€™il sâ€™agit un ordinateur classique.


",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,"Â« RÃ©volution OS Â» s""inscrit dans un concept innovant des systÃ¨mes dâ€™exploitation web hÃ©bergÃ© dans le Cloud Computing, Ã©cologique et accessibles Ã  travers un navigateur classique, une tablette ou mÃªme un simple Smart Phone et qui offre un ensemble de fonctionnalitÃ© basique reflÃ©tant un grand pas dâ€™innovation technologique permettant les entreprises, les universitÃ©s et principalement les Ã©coles tunisiennes de laisser le monopole de Windows et les autres produits chÃ¨res basÃ©s sur les licences, de gagner beaucoup dâ€™argent et   devenir plus performantes.

En effet, Les Ã©coles et les universitÃ©s ne seront pas obligÃ©es de payer les licences pour chaque ordinateur et pour chaque application et pour chaque systÃ¨me installÃ© comme la cas de Windows mais plutÃ´t, les Ã©tudiants et les Ã©coliers vont accÃ©der Ã  leurs applications basiques (traitement bureautique, stockages, recherche, collaboration etc.) Ã  travers une application standard facilement disponible, la plupart du temps un navigateur Web et lâ€™utilisateur va payer uniquement lors de son utilisation de ce systÃ¨me dâ€™exploitation (ModÃ¨le du Cloud Computing) ce qui aboutit Ã  un gain financier trÃ¨s grand pour les gouvernements tunisiennes et africaines.

De plus, Lâ€™hÃ©bergement de cette solution sera dans le Cloud, ce qui rÃ©duit considÃ©rablement lâ€™Ã©nergie utilisÃ© dans les universitÃ©s et les Ã©coles et les organismes publiques et par suite il y aura une rÃ©duction majeure de lâ€™Ã©mission de CO2 et les gaz Ã  effet de serre parce ce que toute lâ€™infrastructure (serveurs, services, logiciels et hardware) sera du ressort d""un fournisseur
","Â« Reliance Tunisie Â» va positionner ses services vers les grands comptes qui ont une grande volumÃ©trie des donnÃ©es clients, qui ont aussi un nombre important des clientÃ¨les comme les gouvernements, les sociÃ©tÃ©s de tÃ©lÃ©communication, les banques tout en se concentrant sur lâ€™industrie et les offres du Cloud Computing et on offrant  Ã  nos clients ce quâ€™on appelle un dÃ©partement de services intÃ©grÃ©Â« All-in-One IT Â».

Les publicitÃ©s vont prendre place dans les journaux dÃ©diÃ©s au business, dans les sites web connus et les rÃ©seaux sociaux, Ã  travers des mÃ©dias numÃ©riques et envoi des mails. De plus Â« Reliance Technology Â» va concevoir une relation publique pour dÃ©velopper une bonne rÃ©putation de lâ€™entreprise et de son mÃ©tier. Cette relation sera construite Ã  travers plusieurs moyens, des journÃ©es portes ouvertes pour les informaticiens, les clients, les partenaires  Ã  travers de laquelle on expose nos produits,

On va mettre aussi un programme de certification et de partenariat avec les grands comptes comme Microsoft, Cisco, Amazona, etc. en plus, on veut faire des relations avec des organismes non commerciales qui ont un but social pour amÃ©liorer notre rÃ©putation social.
Un autre point trÃ¨s important, au sein de Â« Reliance Technology Â», on croit fortement que la veille technologique se fait Ã  travers lâ€™encadrement, câ€™est pour cette raison on va ouvrir les produits vers les Ã©tudiants et les universitÃ©s pour quâ€™ils puissent contribuer et amÃ©liorer nos services sauf bien sur les produits qui contient des donnÃ©es sensibles des clients.

Notre stratÃ©gie de vente va inclure plusieurs canaux et tactiques, ventes directes pour les petits et moyens entreprises et alliance et partenariat avec les fournisseurs de tÃ©lÃ©communication, câ€™est-Ã -dire, passer par un opÃ©rateur ou un prestataire de service qui vend ses services Ã  une population, ce prestataire a un intÃ©rÃªt de vendre nos services qui sont basÃ© sur le systÃ¨me de  facturation :  OpÃ©rateur /Service /Utilisateur.

2)	Les Ã©coles et les universitÃ©s ne sont pas obligÃ©es Ã  payer les licences pour chaque ordinateur et pour chaque application et pour chaque systÃ¨me installÃ© comme la cas de Windows mais plutÃ´t, elles vont accÃ©der au service par une application standard facilement disponible, la plupart du temps un navigateur Web et la facturation se fait  uniquement lorsque il y a une utilisation et pas tout le temps  (câ€™est le modÃ¨le Cloud Computing) ce qui aboutit Ã  un gain financier trÃ¨s grand pour les gouvernements africaines.

3)	Lâ€™hÃ©bergement de la solution Â« RÃ©volution OS Â» sera dans le Cloud, ce qui rÃ©duit considÃ©rablement lâ€™Ã©nergie utilisÃ© dans lâ€™entreprise et les organismes publiques et par suite rÃ©duit lâ€™Ã©mission de CO2 et les gaz Ã  effet de serre parce ce que toute lâ€™infrastructure (serveurs, services, logiciels et hardware) sera du ressort d""un fournisseur expÃ©rimentÃ© comme  Â« Tunisie TelecomÂ», ou Â« Google Â», ou Â« Amazona Â» qui offrent un niveau rigoureux de la sÃ©curitÃ© et la fiabilitÃ© dâ€™infrastructure.

5)	Les utilisateurs (les universitÃ©s et les Ã©coles) ne sont plus gÃ©rant de leurs serveurs informatiques mais peuvent accÃ©der de maniÃ¨re Ã©volutive Ã  de nombreux services en ligne sans avoir Ã  gÃ©rer l""infrastructure sous-jacente, souvent complexe, et câ€™est ce quâ€™on appelle lâ€™informatique dÃ©matÃ©rialisÃ© moderne (Cloud Computing).

On veut ajouter des informations concernant la partie Recherche et dÃ©veloppement et les normes appliquÃ©s au sein de notre entreprise Â« Reliance Tunisie Â» :

ï¶	Recherche & dÃ©veloppement : Â« Reliance Tunisie Â» cherche Ã  sâ€™intÃ©grer avec les Ã©coles et les universitÃ©s pour renforcer son activitÃ© de rechercher et dÃ©veloppement.

ï¶	Normes environnementales : Â« Reliance Tunisie Â» va suivre les bons pratiques liÃ©s Ã  lâ€™aspect Ã©cologie, On envisage dans un future proche passer la certification ISO 14001 de lâ€™environnement.

","Â« Reliance Tunisie Â» va se concentrer exclusivement sur le Cloud Computing et le Â« Software as a service Â» ce qui permet de fournir accÃ¨s Ã  nos produits et solutions Ã  travers un espace de travail virtuel dÃ©matÃ©rialisÃ©. Notre marchÃ© cible va prioriser les opÃ©rateurs tÃ©lÃ©phonique, les fournisseurs de santÃ© public et privÃ©e, le domaine gouvernementale notamment comme lâ€™open Government et lâ€™Open Data  et bien sur le domaine de lâ€™Ã©ducation et la protection de lâ€™environnement.","Le secteur des Logiciels et Services doit jouer un rÃ´le majeur pour mesurer la performance de dÃ©veloppement durable, environnementale en particulier, mÃªme un bureau dâ€™Ã©tude possÃ¨de des impacts nÃ©gatifs sur lâ€™environnement, a quoi bon parler des organismes, Ã©coles et des universitÃ©s africaines qui utilisent une infrastructure informatique et logistique importante (ordinateurs, serveurs, applications, licences des produits, utilisateurs, etc.).

Cette infrastructure traditionnelle est toujours trop compliquÃ©e et onÃ©reuse et surtout trÃ¨s chÃ¨re, je cite Ã  titre dâ€™exemple le contrat fait par lâ€™ancien gouvernement tunisien et Microsoft, 5 ans de licence dâ€™utilisation de Windows dans les universitÃ©s et les Ã©coles pour 20 millions de dinars ! Aussi le contrat fait par Tunisie Telecom et Microsoft, un Million de dinar pour uniquement une licence de 600 utilisateurs, sans prendre en compte les prix de licence des autres produits. 

Donc Ã  quoi bon de parler des pays africaines les plus pauvres parce ce que ces pays ont besoin de faire un progrÃ¨s dans le domaine de lâ€™Ã©ducation et la protection de lâ€™environnement sans perdre beaucoup dâ€™argent, ils ont besoin aussi dâ€™offrir Ã  leur peuple une infrastructure informatique moderne, Ã©cologique, indÃ©pendante des grands constructeurs informatique et aussi avec bas prix.

Donc, En tenant compte des problÃ¨mes de lâ€™Ã©ducation et la pollution dans certaines pays africaines et en partant de tous ses problÃ¨mes liÃ©s Ã  lâ€™Ã©cologie et la protection de lâ€™environnement et la rÃ©duction des coÃ»ts dans les Ã©coles et les universitÃ©s dâ€™Afrique, on prÃ©sente lâ€™idÃ©e dâ€™un systÃ¨me dâ€™exploitation web, Ã©cologique en ligne nommÃ© Â« RÃ©volution OS Â».

Lâ€™intÃ©rÃªt de la solution Â« RÃ©volution OS Â» dÃ©passe le cadre de la crÃ©ation dâ€™une simple application Web ou dâ€™un systÃ¨me d""exploitation proposÃ© Ã  distance (ce quâ€™on appelle virtualisation) mais plutÃ´t lâ€™intÃ©rÃªt est de concevoir un nouveau concept dâ€™applications Ã©cologiques centralisÃ©es accessibles nâ€™importe oÃ¹ et nâ€™importe comment Ã  travers un navigateur classique ou un simple tÃ©lÃ©phone portable contrairement aux systÃ¨mes dâ€™exploitations classiques actuel.

Ce types dâ€™applications fournissent les fonctionnalitÃ©s basiques pour les utilisateurs (suite bureautique, outils de collaboration, navigation, stockage des fichiers, etc.), elles ne nÃ©cessitent pas une licence dâ€™achat ! (le bonheur pour les gouvernements africaines) et elles sont extensibles, c""est-Ã -dire, on peut installer dâ€™autres applications dedans comme sâ€™il sâ€™agit un ordinateur classique.


",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,"Â« RÃ©volution OS Â» s""inscrit dans un concept innovant des systÃ¨mes dâ€™exploitation web hÃ©bergÃ© dans le Cloud Computing, Ã©cologique et accessibles Ã  travers un navigateur classique, une tablette ou mÃªme un simple Smart Phone et qui offre un ensemble de fonctionnalitÃ© basique reflÃ©tant un grand pas dâ€™innovation technologique permettant les entreprises, les universitÃ©s et principalement les Ã©coles tunisiennes de laisser le monopole de Windows et les autres produits chÃ¨res basÃ©s sur les licences, de gagner beaucoup dâ€™argent et   devenir plus performantes.

En effet, Les Ã©coles et les universitÃ©s ne seront pas obligÃ©es de payer les licences pour chaque ordinateur et pour chaque application et pour chaque systÃ¨me installÃ© comme la cas de Windows mais plutÃ´t, les Ã©tudiants et les Ã©coliers vont accÃ©der Ã  leurs applications basiques (traitement bureautique, stockages, recherche, collaboration etc.) Ã  travers une application standard facilement disponible, la plupart du temps un navigateur Web et lâ€™utilisateur va payer uniquement lors de son utilisation de ce systÃ¨me dâ€™exploitation (ModÃ¨le du Cloud Computing) ce qui aboutit Ã  un gain financier trÃ¨s grand pour les gouvernements tunisiennes et africaines.

De plus, Lâ€™hÃ©bergement de cette solution sera dans le Cloud, ce qui rÃ©duit considÃ©rablement lâ€™Ã©nergie utilisÃ© dans les universitÃ©s et les Ã©coles et les organismes publiques et par suite il y aura une rÃ©duction majeure de lâ€™Ã©mission de CO2 et les gaz Ã  effet de serre parce ce que toute lâ€™infrastructure (serveurs, services, logiciels et hardware) sera du ressort d""un fournisseur
","Â« Reliance Tunisie Â» va positionner ses services vers les grands comptes qui ont une grande volumÃ©trie des donnÃ©es clients, qui ont aussi un nombre important des clientÃ¨les comme les gouvernements, les sociÃ©tÃ©s de tÃ©lÃ©communication, les banques tout en se concentrant sur lâ€™industrie et les offres du Cloud Computing et on offrant  Ã  nos clients ce quâ€™on appelle un dÃ©partement de services intÃ©grÃ©Â« All-in-One IT Â».

Les publicitÃ©s vont prendre place dans les journaux dÃ©diÃ©s au business, dans les sites web connus et les rÃ©seaux sociaux, Ã  travers des mÃ©dias numÃ©riques et envoi des mails. De plus Â« Reliance Technology Â» va concevoir une relation publique pour dÃ©velopper une bonne rÃ©putation de lâ€™entreprise et de son mÃ©tier. Cette relation sera construite Ã  travers plusieurs moyens, des journÃ©es portes ouvertes pour les informaticiens, les clients, les partenaires  Ã  travers de laquelle on expose nos produits,

On va mettre aussi un programme de certification et de partenariat avec les grands comptes comme Microsoft, Cisco, Amazona, etc. en plus, on veut faire des relations avec des organismes non commerciales qui ont un but social pour amÃ©liorer notre rÃ©putation social.
Un autre point trÃ¨s important, au sein de Â« Reliance Technology Â», on croit fortement que la veille technologique se fait Ã  travers lâ€™encadrement, câ€™est pour cette raison on va ouvrir les produits vers les Ã©tudiants et les universitÃ©s pour quâ€™ils puissent contribuer et amÃ©liorer nos services sauf bien sur les produits qui contient des donnÃ©es sensibles des clients.

Notre stratÃ©gie de vente va inclure plusieurs canaux et tactiques, ventes directes pour les petits et moyens entreprises et alliance et partenariat avec les fournisseurs de tÃ©lÃ©communication, câ€™est-Ã -dire, passer par un opÃ©rateur ou un prestataire de service qui vend ses services Ã  une population, ce prestataire a un intÃ©rÃªt de vendre nos services qui sont basÃ© sur le systÃ¨me de  facturation :  OpÃ©rateur /Service /Utilisateur.

On veut ajouter des informations concernant la partie Recherche et dÃ©veloppement et les normes appliquÃ©s au sein de notre entreprise Â« Reliance Tunisie Â» :

ï¶	Recherche & dÃ©veloppement : Â« Reliance Tunisie Â» cherche Ã  sâ€™intÃ©grer avec les Ã©coles et les universitÃ©s pour renforcer son activitÃ© de rechercher et dÃ©veloppement.

ï¶	Normes environnementales : Â« Reliance Tunisie Â» va suivre les bons pratiques liÃ©s Ã  lâ€™aspect Ã©cologie, On envisage dans un future proche passer la certification ISO 14001 de lâ€™environnement.

","Â« Reliance Tunisie Â» va se concentrer exclusivement sur le Cloud Computing et le Â« Software as a service Â» ce qui permet de fournir accÃ¨s Ã  nos produits et solutions Ã  travers un espace de travail virtuel dÃ©matÃ©rialisÃ©. Notre marchÃ© cible va prioriser les opÃ©rateurs tÃ©lÃ©phonique, les fournisseurs de santÃ© public et privÃ©e, le domaine gouvernementale notamment comme lâ€™open Government et lâ€™Open Data  et bien sur le domaine de lâ€™Ã©ducation et la protection de lâ€™environnement.","Le secteur des Logiciels et Services doit jouer un rÃ´le majeur pour mesurer la performance de dÃ©veloppement durable, environnementale en particulier, mÃªme un bureau dâ€™Ã©tude possÃ¨de des impacts nÃ©gatifs sur lâ€™environnement, a quoi bon parler des organismes, Ã©coles et des universitÃ©s africaines qui utilisent une infrastructure informatique et logistique importante (ordinateurs, serveurs, applications, licences des produits, utilisateurs, etc.).

Cette infrastructure traditionnelle est toujours trop compliquÃ©e et onÃ©reuse et surtout trÃ¨s chÃ¨re, je cite Ã  titre dâ€™exemple le contrat fait par lâ€™ancien gouvernement tunisien et Microsoft, 5 ans de licence dâ€™utilisation de Windows dans les universitÃ©s et les Ã©coles pour 20 millions de dinars ! Aussi le contrat fait par Tunisie Telecom et Microsoft, un Million de dinar pour uniquement une licence de 600 utilisateurs, sans prendre en compte les prix de licence des autres produits. 

Donc Ã  quoi bon de parler des pays africaines les plus pauvres parce ce que ces pays ont besoin de faire un progrÃ¨s dans le domaine de lâ€™Ã©ducation et la protection de lâ€™environnement sans perdre beaucoup dâ€™argent, ils ont besoin aussi dâ€™offrir Ã  leur peuple une infrastructure informatique moderne, Ã©cologique, indÃ©pendante des grands constructeurs informatique et aussi avec bas prix.

Donc, En tenant compte des problÃ¨mes de lâ€™Ã©ducation et la pollution dans certaines pays africaines et en partant de tous ses problÃ¨mes liÃ©s Ã  lâ€™Ã©cologie et la protection de lâ€™environnement et la rÃ©duction des coÃ»ts dans les Ã©coles et les universitÃ©s dâ€™Afrique, on prÃ©sente lâ€™idÃ©e dâ€™un systÃ¨me dâ€™exploitation web, Ã©cologique en ligne nommÃ© Â« RÃ©volution OS Â».

Lâ€™intÃ©rÃªt de la solution Â« RÃ©volution OS Â» dÃ©passe le cadre de la crÃ©ation dâ€™une simple application Web ou dâ€™un systÃ¨me d""exploitation proposÃ© Ã  distance (ce quâ€™on appelle virtualisation) mais plutÃ´t lâ€™intÃ©rÃªt est de concevoir un nouveau concept dâ€™applications Ã©cologiques centralisÃ©es accessibles nâ€™importe oÃ¹ et nâ€™importe comment Ã  travers un navigateur classique ou un simple tÃ©lÃ©phone portable contrairement aux systÃ¨mes dâ€™exploitations classiques actuel.

Ce types dâ€™applications fournissent les fonctionnalitÃ©s basiques pour les utilisateurs (suite bureautique, outils de collaboration, navigation, stockage des fichiers, etc.), elles ne nÃ©cessitent pas une licence dâ€™achat ! (le bonheur pour les gouvernements africaines) et elles sont extensibles, c""est-Ã -dire, on peut installer dâ€™autres applications dedans comme sâ€™il sâ€™agit un ordinateur classique.


",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,"Â« RÃ©volution OS Â» s""inscrit dans un concept innovant des systÃ¨mes dâ€™exploitation web hÃ©bergÃ© dans le Cloud Computing, Ã©cologique et accessibles Ã  travers un navigateur classique, une tablette ou mÃªme un simple Smart Phone et qui offre un ensemble de fonctionnalitÃ© basique reflÃ©tant un grand pas dâ€™innovation technologique permettant les entreprises, les universitÃ©s et principalement les Ã©coles tunisiennes de laisser le monopole de Windows et les autres produits chÃ¨res basÃ©s sur les licences, de gagner beaucoup dâ€™argent et   devenir plus performantes.

En effet, Les Ã©coles et les universitÃ©s ne seront pas obligÃ©es de payer les licences pour chaque ordinateur et pour chaque application et pour chaque systÃ¨me installÃ© comme la cas de Windows mais plutÃ´t, les Ã©tudiants et les Ã©coliers vont accÃ©der Ã  leurs applications basiques (traitement bureautique, stockages, recherche, collaboration etc.) Ã  travers une application standard facilement disponible, la plupart du temps un navigateur Web et lâ€™utilisateur va payer uniquement lors de son utilisation de ce systÃ¨me dâ€™exploitation (ModÃ¨le du Cloud Computing) ce qui aboutit Ã  un gain financier trÃ¨s grand pour les gouvernements tunisiennes et africaines.

De plus, Lâ€™hÃ©bergement de cette solution sera dans le Cloud, ce qui rÃ©duit considÃ©rablement lâ€™Ã©nergie utilisÃ© dans les universitÃ©s et les Ã©coles et les organismes publiques et par suite il y aura une rÃ©duction majeure de lâ€™Ã©mission de CO2 et les gaz Ã  effet de serre parce ce que toute lâ€™infrastructure (serveurs, services, logiciels et hardware) sera du ressort d""un fournisseur
","Â« Reliance Tunisie Â» va positionner ses services vers les grands comptes qui ont une grande volumÃ©trie des donnÃ©es clients, qui ont aussi un nombre important des clientÃ¨les comme les gouvernements, les sociÃ©tÃ©s de tÃ©lÃ©communication, les banques tout en se concentrant sur lâ€™industrie et les offres du Cloud Computing et on offrant  Ã  nos clients ce quâ€™on appelle un dÃ©partement de services intÃ©grÃ©Â« All-in-One IT Â».

Les publicitÃ©s vont prendre place dans les journaux dÃ©diÃ©s au business, dans les sites web connus et les rÃ©seaux sociaux, Ã  travers des mÃ©dias numÃ©riques et envoi des mails. De plus Â« Reliance Technology Â» va concevoir une relation publique pour dÃ©velopper une bonne rÃ©putation de lâ€™entreprise et de son mÃ©tier. Cette relation sera construite Ã  travers plusieurs moyens, des journÃ©es portes ouvertes pour les informaticiens, les clients, les partenaires  Ã  travers de laquelle on expose nos produits,

On va mettre aussi un programme de certification et de partenariat avec les grands comptes comme Microsoft, Cisco, Amazona, etc. en plus, on veut faire des relations avec des organismes non commerciales qui ont un but social pour amÃ©liorer notre rÃ©putation social.
Un autre point trÃ¨s important, au sein de Â« Reliance Technology Â», on croit fortement que la veille technologique se fait Ã  travers lâ€™encadrement, câ€™est pour cette raison on va ouvrir les produits vers les Ã©tudiants et les universitÃ©s pour quâ€™ils puissent contribuer et amÃ©liorer nos services sauf bien sur les produits qui contient des donnÃ©es sensibles des clients.

Notre stratÃ©gie de vente va inclure plusieurs canaux et tactiques, ventes directes pour les petits et moyens entreprises et alliance et partenariat avec les fournisseurs de tÃ©lÃ©communication, câ€™est-Ã -dire, passer par un opÃ©rateur ou un prestataire de service qui vend ses services Ã  une population, ce prestataire a un intÃ©rÃªt de vendre nos services qui sont basÃ© sur le systÃ¨me de  facturation :  OpÃ©rateur /Service /Utilisateur.

1. The inability of today""s young society to be able to finance their residences"" finishing and furnishing. The ability to finance furniture does exist in a limited fashion, however, because finishing is usually completed by small, semi-formal companies, financing is usually not an option.

2. The lack of space-saving and efficient furniture that complies with the limited spaces available to today""s low-middle income youth. Floor space is expensive, and furniture in the region has not yet adapted to match the increasingly demanding needs of consumers.

3. The availability of skilled furniture workers that have no access to smart designs, while their skill levels can be commendable.

4. The time-consuming process that is finishing and furnishing a house or an apartment, which is faced by many low-middle income newly-weds, who are usually torn apart between their daily obligations and the errands that come with finishing and furnishing a house. Additionally, the process may be elongated by lack of funds, which is also a major issue faced by many youth, and one that can be easily solved by cheap financing.",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,"The idea behind our project is to provide turn-key finishing and furnishing for low to middle income housing. Utilizing modern concepts and space saving designs, coupled with local mass production, cheap and semi-skilled construction labor, we would be able to provide quality interior finishing at competitive prices.

Tarik Nesh-Nash est le fondateur de Software Centre, start-up IT Ã  lâ€™origine de plusieurs success stories nationales, notamment reforme.ma et marsad.ma.
Auparavant, Tarik a Ã©tÃ© Senior Manager Ã  Microsoft  oÃ¹ il a travaillÃ© en Chine (Beijing) et Ã  Seattle (siÃ¨ge de Microsoft).
Tarik a une expÃ©rience solide en dÃ©veloppement de systÃ¨mes dâ€™information et gestion de projet IT.
Tarik sera responsable des Ã©quipes de dÃ©veloppement et de la conception  du site.
Ali Nesh-Nash est un consultant senior en stratÃ©gie Ã  Accenture, en France. Il a conseillÃ© les cadres dirigeants dirigeants dâ€™acteurs majeurs aux niveaux europÃ©en et asiatique pour aligner leurs systÃ¨mes dâ€™information Ã  leurs enjeux stratÃ©gique.
Au cours de ses projets, Ali a dÃ©veloppÃ© un sens de l""ananlyse stratÃ©gique qui sera utile pour dÃ©finir la vision d""implÃ©mentation.
Ali sera responsable de dÃ©finir la stratÃ©gie de l""entreprise Ã  tous les niveaux. Il effectuera cela de concert avec le reste de l""Ã©quipe.
Nour Nesh-Nash est une jeune diplÃ´mÃ©e de grande Ã©cole de commerce fraÃ§aise, elle apportera la vision commerciale et la gestion administrative (RH, budget, etc.) nÃ©cessaire Ã  la rÃ©ussite du projet.

Les diffÃ©rences complÃ©mentaires de nos profils nous amÃ¨nent Ã  croire que nous disposons de toutes les compÃ©tences pour mener Ã  bien ce projet. Les points communs sont multiples, le principal Ã©tant l""enthousiasme que nous avons pour rÃ©aliser ce projet.",,"Des Ã©quivalents du produit proposÃ© existent dÃ©jÃ  dans les pays dâ€™Europe, en Chine et en AmÃ©rique. Le produit est innovant par le marchÃ© auquel il sâ€™adresse, qui est le marchÃ© marocain qui ne dispose pas dâ€™un agrÃ©gateur fiable, visible et concentrant une large gamme dâ€™offres dans son contenu. Lâ€™innovation rÃ©side dans la proposition au marchÃ© marocain dâ€™un produit qui nâ€™existe pas encore localement dans ce pays.

Les achats Ã©lectroniques sont en dÃ©veloppement au Maroc. Lâ€™Ã©conomie et la sociÃ©tÃ© marocaines ont connu des changements notables dans leurs comportements dâ€™achat ces derniÃ¨res annÃ©es et les habitudes tendent Ã  Ã©voluer comme dans le modÃ¨le occidental vers une consommation et des achats sur internet de plus en plus marquÃ©e.

NÃ©anmoins, si lâ€™accÃ¨s a internet et les moyens de paiement informatiques se sont largement dÃ©mocratisÃ©s au cours des derniÃ¨res annÃ©es les sites internet sont encore a la traine et il nâ€™existe pas Ã  lâ€™heure actuelle dâ€™agrÃ©gateur reconnu permettant aux consommateurs de comparer et dâ€™effectuer des achats de produits divers sur internet au Maroc, les sites existants Ã©tant trÃ¨s limites en termes de qualitÃ© du contenu et en termes de visibilitÃ©. Le produit qui est proposÃ© ici est innovant parce quâ€™il sâ€™appuie sur les modÃ¨les dâ€™agrÃ©gateurs occidentaux leaders sur leurs marches en sâ€™appuyant sur les spÃ©cificitÃ©s locales pour rÃ©pondre au besoin actuel des marocains dÃ©sireux dâ€™effectuer des recherches et des achats de produits sur internet. Le produit tel quâ€™il est conÃ§u est novateur et nâ€™a pas de concurrent direct au Maroc de faÃ§on spÃ©cifique et au sein des pays du Maghreb en gÃ©nÃ©ral.",,"Le volume du marchÃ© Ã©lectronique  Ã©tait de 70 millions de $ en 2011 (source MCI).
Ce chiffre est surestimÃ© car il prend Ã©galement en compte les transactions de paiements Ã©lectroniques Maroc TÃ©lÃ©com, Lydec, etc.. La MCI ne fournit pas de chiffres officiels Ã  ce sujet.
Etant donnÃ© cette incertitude et le marchÃ© Ã©lectronique marocain qui reste embryonnaire au vu de lâ€™importance de ces sociÃ©tÃ©s dans lâ€™Ã©conomie marocaine, nous estimons que le ratio des transactions Ã©lectronique est entre 80 et 90%.
Sur la base de cette hypothÃ¨se, le marchÃ© Ã©lectronique marocain Ã©tait donc de 14 millions de $ en 2011.
Les analyses prÃ©visionnelles indiquent que le taux de croissance sera Ã  3 chiffres pour les 4 prochaines annÃ©es Ã  venir. Cette croissance prÃ©vue est confirmÃ©e par lâ€™analyse comparative du ratio volume du marchÃ© Ã©lectronique / PIB qui reste relativement faible au Maroc.",,,"Il n""existe pas de compÃ©titeur direct dans le panorama internet actuel des pays du Maghreb.
A date, il n""existe aucun agrÃ©gateur web dans le paysage internet marocain.
Les compÃ©titeurs  indirects sont les suivants :

- Des moteurs de recherche qui fournissent un accÃ¨s direct Ã  des site eCommerce (Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc.). 
- Les support matÃ©riels (catalogue de produits notamment) sont les principaux concurrents de l""agrÃ©gateur.

- Les sites de ventes en ligne du marchÃ© intÃ©rieur. Ces sites sont en gÃ©nÃ©ral spÃ©cialisÃ©s ou associÃ© Ã  une marque particuliÃ¨re. Notre stratÃ©gie est de nous enrichir du contenu de ces sites pour centraliser le trafic et les clients potentiels. 

- Les grand sites gÃ©nÃ©ralistes de vente en ligne (tels que eBay, Amazon) : ces sites ont trÃ¨s peu de pÃ©nÃ©tration dans les pays du Maghreb.",,,,"Nous pensons gÃ©nÃ©rer des revenus par deux moyens: 
1- PublicitÃ© au sein de la plateforme :
Les revenus dÃ©pendent du trafic du site.
Environ 5 utilisateurs sur 1000 cliquent sur un affichage publicitaire. Un clic gÃ©nÃ¨re 0,15 DHs.
Nous estimons pouvoir un revenu publicitaire couvrant la totalitÃ© des coÃ»ts de structure Ã  partir de 2014.
2- Partenariats avec les sites bÃ©nÃ©ficiant du trafic redirigÃ©:
Il s""agit de la principal source de revenus. La facturation sera en fonction du trafic redirigÃ© vers dâ€™autres sites. Des ""partenriats"" seront Ã  mettre en place (modÃ¨le alibaba) pour disposer dâ€™un modÃ¨le gÃ©nÃ©rique de facturation. Nous estimons quâ€™en moyenne, un client redirigÃ© pourra Ãªtre facturÃ© 0,15$..","Lâ€™avantage concurrentiel de notre produit reside dans le fait que nous sommes pionniers sur le marche grÃ¢ce aux facteurs cle de succes de notre agrÃ©gateur qui sont la fiabilite et la securite des transactions, la concentration sur un meme agrÃ©gateur dâ€™une large gamme dâ€™offres de produits de diffÃ©rentes natures, lâ€™ergonomie de la page internet et surtout la rapidite de mise sur le marche et la forte visibilite qui sera acquise sur internet par le biais dâ€™une politique de webmarketing aggressive.

Lâ€™image de marque assise sur ces princinpes qui sera ainsi crÃ©Ã©e sera gage de qualitÃ© et fera toute la difference avec les concurrents indirects sur le marche que peuvent-etre dâ€™autres sites marchands ou agregateurs a offres et visibilite limitees.

Le seul moyen de maintenir lâ€™avantage concurrentiel relatif a cette image de marque est la rapidite de mise sur le marche et la possibilite de profiter rapidement du first mover advantage et de le perenniser par le biais dâ€™une strategie commerciale efficace.

Les nouveaux entrants auront ainsi plus de mal a rattrapper un dÃ©veloppement rapide de notre produit.","Nous estimons avoir besoin de 135 000 $ pour construire disposer d""une plateforme implantÃ©e solidement solide dans le paysage Internet marocain.

Les ressources nÃ©cessaires pour atteindre cet objectif sont les suivantes:
- 3 ingÃ©nieurs pour dÃ©velopper la plateforme et les mÃ©canismes d""intÃ©gration avec les diffÃ©rents sites,
Le coÃ»t d""un ingÃ©nieur de qualitÃ© au Maroc est de 13 000 DHs. Les ingÃ©nieurs ont besoin de 4 mois pour dÃ©velopper une premiÃ¨re version, et de cycle de dÃ©veloppement de 3 mois.
- Un commercial pour construire les diffÃ©rents partenariats et dÃ©velopper l""offre marketing.
Le salaire d""un commercial au Maroc est autour de 10 000 DHs par mois. Un seul commercial sera Ã  recruter 3 mois aprÃ¨s le dÃ©but des premiers dÃ©veloppements.
- 1 Assistant(e) au coÃ»t de 400$ par mois.

CoÃ»ts de location :
- La location d""un bureau estimÃ© Ã  600 $ par mois.
- Entretien et logistique : 200 $ par mois.
- CoÃ»ts administratifs : 170$ par mois.
- CoÃ»ts d""hÃ©bergement (variable en fonction du volume de trafic): 100 $/mois en moyenne sur la premiÃ¨re annÃ©e.

Notre analyse des revenus vs coÃ»ts nous indique que l""Ã©quilibre budgÃ©taire sera atteint aprÃ¨s 18 mois environ. Ce qui nous amÃ¨ne aux coÃ»s suivants :

CoÃ»ts RH : 
IngÃ©nieurs (3) : 3*1300*18 = 70 200
Commerciaux (1) : 1000*15 = 15 000
Assistante : 400 * 18 = 7 200

CoÃ»ts de matÃ©riels :
Hardware : 11 000 $ (incluant rÃ©paration)
Location : 600*18 = 10 800
HÃ©bergement : 100*18= 1800 $
CoÃ»ts de license logiciel : 0$ (gratuit pour start-ups)

CoÃ»ts administratifs : 3000$

Le produit est innovant par le marchÃ© auquel il sâ€™adresse, qui est le marchÃ© marocain qui ne dispose pas dâ€™un agrÃ©gateur fiable, visible et concentrant une large gamme dâ€™offres dans son contenu. Lâ€™innovation rÃ©side dans la proposition au marchÃ© marocain dâ€™un produit qui nâ€™existe pas encore localement dans ce pays.

Les achats Ã©lectroniques sont en dÃ©veloppement au Maroc. Lâ€™Ã©conomie et la sociÃ©tÃ© marocaines ont connu des changements notables dans leurs comportements dâ€™achat ces derniÃ¨res annÃ©es et les habitudes tendent Ã  Ã©voluer comme dans le modÃ¨le occidental vers une consommation et des achats sur internet de plus en plus marquÃ©e.

Etant donnÃ© cette incertitude et le marchÃ© Ã©lectronique marocain qui reste embryonnaire au vu de lâ€™importance de ces sociÃ©tÃ©s dans lâ€™Ã©conomie marocaine, nous estimons que le ratio des transactions Ã©lectronique est entre 80 et 90%.

Les analyses prÃ©visionnelles indiquent que le taux de croissance sera Ã  3 chiffres pour les 4 prochaines annÃ©es Ã  venir.

- Les sites de ventes en ligne du marchÃ© intÃ©rieur. Ces sites sont en gÃ©nÃ©ral spÃ©cialisÃ©s ou associÃ© Ã  une marque particuliÃ¨re. Notre stratÃ©gie est de nous enrichir du contenu de ces sites pour centraliser le trafic et les clients potentiels. 

- Les grand sites gÃ©nÃ©ralistes de vente en ligne (tels que eBay, Amazon) : ces sites ont trÃ¨s peu de pÃ©nÃ©tration dans les pays du Maghreb.",,,,"Nous pensons gÃ©nÃ©rer des revenus par deux moyens: 
1- PublicitÃ© au sein de la plateforme :
Les revenus dÃ©pendent du trafic du site.
Environ 5 utilisateurs sur 1000 cliquent sur un affichage publicitaire. Un clic gÃ©nÃ¨re 0,15 DHs.
Nous estimons pouvoir un revenu publicitaire couvrant la totalitÃ© des coÃ»ts de structure Ã  partir de 2014.
2- Partenariats avec les sites bÃ©nÃ©ficiant du trafic redirigÃ©:
Il s""agit de la principal source de revenus. La facturation sera en fonction du trafic redirigÃ© vers dâ€™autres sites. Des ""partenriats"" seront Ã  mettre en place (modÃ¨le alibaba) pour disposer dâ€™un modÃ¨le gÃ©nÃ©rique de facturation. Nous estimons quâ€™en moyenne, un client redirigÃ© pourra Ãªtre facturÃ© 0,15$..","Lâ€™avantage concurrentiel de notre produit reside dans le fait que nous sommes pionniers sur le marche grÃ¢ce aux facteurs cle de succes de notre agrÃ©gateur qui sont la fiabilite et la securite des transactions, la concentration sur un meme agrÃ©gateur dâ€™une large gamme dâ€™offres de produits de diffÃ©rentes natures, lâ€™ergonomie de la page internet et surtout la rapidite de mise sur le marche et la forte visibilite qui sera acquise sur internet par le biais dâ€™une politique de webmarketing aggressive.

Lâ€™image de marque assise sur ces princinpes qui sera ainsi crÃ©Ã©e sera gage de qualitÃ© et fera toute la difference avec les concurrents indirects sur le marche que peuvent-etre dâ€™autres sites marchands ou agregateurs a offres et visibilite limitees.

Le seul moyen de maintenir lâ€™avantage concurrentiel relatif a cette image de marque est la rapidite de mise sur le marche et la possibilite de profiter rapidement du first mover advantage et de le perenniser par le biais dâ€™une strategie commerciale efficace.

Les nouveaux entrants auront ainsi plus de mal a rattrapper un dÃ©veloppement rapide de notre produit.","Nous estimons avoir besoin de 135 000 $ pour construire disposer d""une plateforme implantÃ©e solidement solide dans le paysage Internet marocain.

Les ressources nÃ©cessaires pour atteindre cet objectif sont les suivantes:
- 3 ingÃ©nieurs pour dÃ©velopper la plateforme et les mÃ©canismes d""intÃ©gration avec les diffÃ©rents sites,
Le coÃ»t d""un ingÃ©nieur de qualitÃ© au Maroc est de 13 000 DHs. Les ingÃ©nieurs ont besoin de 4 mois pour dÃ©velopper une premiÃ¨re version, et de cycle de dÃ©veloppement de 3 mois.
- Un commercial pour construire les diffÃ©rents partenariats et dÃ©velopper l""offre marketing.
Le salaire d""un commercial au Maroc est autour de 10 000 DHs par mois. Un seul commercial sera Ã  recruter 3 mois aprÃ¨s le dÃ©but des premiers dÃ©veloppements.
- 1 Assistant(e) au coÃ»t de 400$ par mois.

CoÃ»ts de location :
- La location d""un bureau estimÃ© Ã  600 $ par mois.
- Entretien et logistique : 200 $ par mois.
- CoÃ»ts administratifs : 170$ par mois.
- CoÃ»ts d""hÃ©bergement (variable en fonction du volume de trafic): 100 $/mois en moyenne sur la premiÃ¨re annÃ©e.

Notre analyse des revenus vs coÃ»ts nous indique que l""Ã©quilibre budgÃ©taire sera atteint aprÃ¨s 18 mois environ. Ce qui nous amÃ¨ne aux coÃ»s suivants :

CoÃ»ts RH : 
IngÃ©nieurs (3) : 3*1300*18 = 70 200
Commerciaux (1) : 1000*15 = 15 000
Assistante : 400 * 18 = 7 200

CoÃ»ts de matÃ©riels :
Hardware : 11 000 $ (incluant rÃ©paration)
Location : 600*18 = 10 800
HÃ©bergement : 100*18= 1800 $

Etant donnÃ© cette incertitude et le marchÃ© Ã©lectronique marocain qui reste embryonnaire au vu de lâ€™importance de ces sociÃ©tÃ©s dans lâ€™Ã©conomie marocaine, nous estimons que le ratio des transactions Ã©lectronique est entre 80 et 90%.
Sur la base de cette hypothÃ¨se, le marchÃ© Ã©lectronique marocain Ã©tait donc de 14 millions de $ en 2011.
Les analyses prÃ©visionnelles indiquent que le taux de croissance sera Ã  3 chiffres pour les 4 prochaines annÃ©es Ã  venir. Cette croissance prÃ©vue est confirmÃ©e par lâ€™analyse comparative du ratio volume du marchÃ© Ã©lectronique / PIB qui reste relativement faible au Maroc.",,,"Il n""existe pas de compÃ©titeur direct dans le panorama internet actuel des pays du Maghreb.
A date, il n""existe aucun agrÃ©gateur web dans le paysage internet marocain.
Les compÃ©titeurs  indirects sont les suivants :

- Des moteurs de recherche qui fournissent un accÃ¨s direct Ã  des site eCommerce (Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc.). 
- Les support matÃ©riels (catalogue de produits notamment) sont les principaux concurrents de l""agrÃ©gateur.

- Les sites de ventes en ligne du marchÃ© intÃ©rieur. Ces sites sont en gÃ©nÃ©ral spÃ©cialisÃ©s ou associÃ© Ã  une marque particuliÃ¨re. Notre stratÃ©gie est de nous enrichir du contenu de ces sites pour centraliser le trafic et les clients potentiels. 

- Les grand sites gÃ©nÃ©ralistes de vente en ligne (tels que eBay, Amazon) : ces sites ont trÃ¨s peu de pÃ©nÃ©tration dans les pays du Maghreb.",,,,"Nous pensons gÃ©nÃ©rer des revenus par deux moyens: 
1- PublicitÃ© au sein de la plateforme :
Les revenus dÃ©pendent du trafic du site.
Environ 5 utilisateurs sur 1000 cliquent sur un affichage publicitaire. Un clic gÃ©nÃ¨re 0,15 DHs.
Nous estimons pouvoir un revenu publicitaire couvrant la totalitÃ© des coÃ»ts de structure Ã  partir de 2014.
2- Partenariats avec les sites bÃ©nÃ©ficiant du trafic redirigÃ©:
Il s""agit de la principal source de revenus. La facturation sera en fonction du trafic redirigÃ© vers dâ€™autres sites. Des ""partenriats"" seront Ã  mettre en place (modÃ¨le alibaba) pour disposer dâ€™un modÃ¨le gÃ©nÃ©rique de facturation. Nous estimons quâ€™en moyenne, un client redirigÃ© pourra Ãªtre facturÃ© 0,15$..","Lâ€™avantage concurrentiel de notre produit reside dans le fait que nous sommes pionniers sur le marche grÃ¢ce aux facteurs cle de succes de notre agrÃ©gateur qui sont la fiabilite et la securite des transactions, la concentration sur un meme agrÃ©gateur dâ€™une large gamme dâ€™offres de produits de diffÃ©rentes natures, lâ€™ergonomie de la page internet et surtout la rapidite de mise sur le marche et la forte visibilite qui sera acquise sur internet par le biais dâ€™une politique de webmarketing aggressive.

Lâ€™image de marque assise sur ces princinpes qui sera ainsi crÃ©Ã©e sera gage de qualitÃ© et fera toute la difference avec les concurrents indirects sur le marche que peuvent-etre dâ€™autres sites marchands ou agregateurs a offres et visibilite limitees.

Le seul moyen de maintenir lâ€™avantage concurrentiel relatif a cette image de marque est la rapidite de mise sur le marche et la possibilite de profiter rapidement du first mover advantage et de le perenniser par le biais dâ€™une strategie commerciale efficace.

Les nouveaux entrants auront ainsi plus de mal a rattrapper un dÃ©veloppement rapide de notre produit.","Nous estimons avoir besoin de 135 000 $ pour construire disposer d""une plateforme implantÃ©e solidement solide dans le paysage Internet marocain.

Les ressources nÃ©cessaires pour atteindre cet objectif sont les suivantes:
- 3 ingÃ©nieurs pour dÃ©velopper la plateforme et les mÃ©canismes d""intÃ©gration avec les diffÃ©rents sites,
Le coÃ»t d""un ingÃ©nieur de qualitÃ© au Maroc est de 13 000 DHs. Les ingÃ©nieurs ont besoin de 4 mois pour dÃ©velopper une premiÃ¨re version, et de cycle de dÃ©veloppement de 3 mois.
- Un commercial pour construire les diffÃ©rents partenariats et dÃ©velopper l""offre marketing.
Le salaire d""un commercial au Maroc est autour de 10 000 DHs par mois. Un seul commercial sera Ã  recruter 3 mois aprÃ¨s le dÃ©but des premiers dÃ©veloppements.
- 1 Assistant(e) au coÃ»t de 400$ par mois.

CoÃ»ts de location :
- La location d""un bureau estimÃ© Ã  600 $ par mois.
- Entretien et logistique : 200 $ par mois.
- CoÃ»ts administratifs : 170$ par mois.
- CoÃ»ts d""hÃ©bergement (variable en fonction du volume de trafic): 100 $/mois en moyenne sur la premiÃ¨re annÃ©e.

Notre analyse des revenus vs coÃ»ts nous indique que l""Ã©quilibre budgÃ©taire sera atteint aprÃ¨s 18 mois environ. Ce qui nous amÃ¨ne aux coÃ»s suivants :

CoÃ»ts RH : 
IngÃ©nieurs (3) : 3*1300*18 = 70 200
Commerciaux (1) : 1000*15 = 15 000
Assistante : 400 * 18 = 7 200

CoÃ»ts de matÃ©riels :
Hardware : 11 000 $ (incluant rÃ©paration)
Location : 600*18 = 10 800
HÃ©bergement : 100*18= 1800 $
CoÃ»ts de license logiciel : 0$ (gratuit pour start-ups)

CoÃ»ts administratifs : 3000$

Autre coÃ»ts (entretien) : 3600$

Soit un coÃ»t total de 122 000 $. 

Pour gÃ©rer les alÃ©as du cash et le fond de roulement, nous souhaitons majorer cette somme de 2 mois, soit une somme finale de 135 000$.
Dans le cadre de notre levÃ©e de fond, nous avons dÃ©ja des promesses d""investissement Ã  hauteur de 40 000 $. Les fonds de l""Ã©quipe sont de 30 000 $. Nous souhaitons  donc lever des fonds Ã  hauteur de 52 000$.",,"Les PME sont le socle du tissu Ã©conomique. Elles reprÃ©sentent plus de 90% de l""ensemble des entreprises et sont le poumon de l""Ã©conomie.
Un agrÃ©gateur online fournit la possibilitÃ© d""Ã©tendre le marchÃ© d""une PME au delÃ  de sa localisation ou son rÃ©seau de distribution physique, il permet d""avoir un marchÃ© potentiellement limitÃ© Ã  l""ensemble des internautes en capacitÃ© d""acheter.
Il fournit un rÃ©el vecteur de croissance Ã  toutes ces entreprises qui ont des vÃ©ritables avantages conncurrentiels au niveau de leur prix ou qualitÃ© mais ne bÃ©nÃ©ficient pas de la force commerciale nÃ©cessaire Ã  leur expansion.
Nous sommes convaincus que ce projet, au dela de sa dimension Ã©conomique affirmÃ©e, a une dimension sociale qui peut catalyser la croissance (crÃ©ation de nouveaux emplois et contribution Ã  l""augmentation du PNB/habitant notamment).","Gestion de risques :

1- Risque que le trafic soit en dessous des seuil attendus :
Le trafic de la plateforme est le facteur clÃ© de succÃ¨s du projet.
Nous effectuerons plusieurs actions proactives pour mitiger ce risque :
PublicitÃ©,
RÃ©fÃ©rencement pour apparaÃ®tre en tÃªte de liste dans les recherches Google,
IntÃ©gration avec les rÃ©seaux sociaux pour effectuer une campagne de marketing virale,
Ciblage des sites B2C les plus visitÃ©s dans la phase initial.

2- DifficultÃ© Ã  Ã©tablir des contrats commerciaux

Une stratÃ©gie commerciale est Ã  dÃ©finir pour Ã©tablir des partenariats de faÃ§on rapide.
Un focus devra Ãªtre portÃ© Ã  la qualitÃ© des ressources commerciales,
Le pilotage des ressources commerciales ainsi que les mÃ©canismes dâ€™incitation Ã  la performance devront Ãªtre soigneusement affinÃ©es,
Pour mitiger le poids de ce risque, dâ€™autres sources de revenus seront effectifs tels que la publicitÃ© sur le portail dâ€™agrÃ©gation.

3- Nouvel entrant sur le marchÃ©

Actuellement inexploitÃ©, nous estimons que le marchÃ© permet la prÃ©sence de plusieurs acteurs dâ€™agrÃ©gation. Toutefois, ce risque est mitigÃ© par un les actions suivantes :
Lancement rapide du projet et notamment une stratÃ©gie commerciale agressive pour pÃ©nÃ©trer le marchÃ© des partenaires,
Lâ€™intÃ©gration de fonctionnalitÃ©s conÃ§ues pour augmenter le taux de retour des visiteurs du site (fidÃ©lisation).","Le marche cible est l""ensemble des pays au sein de la zone MENA (Middle East and North Africa).
Toutefois pour la premiÃ¨re cible, nous souhaitons de faÃ§on pragmatique nous concentrer sur le Maroc que nous considÃ©rons comme un pilote de lancement qui permettra de valider la plateforme pour la dÃ©ployer sur d""autres pays. A noter que le dÃ©ploiement peut s""effectuer sur plusieurs pÃ©rimÃ¨tres:
1- B2C, qui est notre pÃ©rimÃ¨tre initial permettant de gÃ©nÃ©rer le trafic nÃ©cessaire Ã  l""expansion ciblÃ©e.
2- C2C pour gÃ©rer les Ã©changes entre internautes.
3- B2B, Ã©changes d""entreprises","1- Absence sur le marchÃ© dâ€™un agrÃ©gateur permettant de repondre au consommateur qui cherche Ã  acheter un produit donnÃ© au Maroc et veut obtenir les differentes offres existantes sur le marchÃ©.
2- Les sites internet ecommerce actuels sont essentiellement des sites d""achat groupÃ©s disperses, peu visibles sur les moteurs de recherche et prÃ©sentant une gamme dâ€™offres tres limitee en termes de produits en se concentrant le plus souvent sur les offres promotionnelles
3- MalgrÃ© les moyens de paiement informatiques dont il dispose de plus en plus et son desir de sâ€™informer et dâ€™acheter des biens sur internet le consommateur est limitÃ© par le nombre reduit de produits decrits et proposÃ©s et par le nombre de sites differents et ne dispose pas dâ€™un site regroupant les reponses a tous ses besoins.

Le consommateur doit souvent recourir Ã  des sites internet Ã©trangers pour des propositions et des descriptions de produits de qualite mais il est limitÃ© par le nombre dâ€™achats en devise quâ€™il peut effectuer et ne trouve pas lâ€™equivalent des agrÃ©gateurs Ã©trangers concentrant la rÃ©ponse a tous ses besoins dâ€™achat au Maroc, c""est a ce besoin du marche que nous repondons.",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,"Dans le contexte actuel de la zone MENA, nous considÃ©rons le moment propice pour la crÃ©ation dâ€™un agrÃ©gateur.

Qu""est ce qu""un agrÃ©gateur :
Une plateforme internet ouverte qui fournit des informations actualisÃ©es sur des produits commercialisÃ©s par dâ€™autres 

fournisseurs (ci-dessous, exemple dâ€™alibaba.com).

Pourquoi un agrÃ©gateur au Maroc, maintenant?

Les indicateurs de lâ€™Ã©volution du marchÃ© Ã©lectronique marocain sont au vert et prÃ©sagent une croissance soutenue et soutenable :

1- Un chiffre dâ€™affaire avec des pourcentages dâ€™Ã©volutions Ã  3 chiffres : Le volume de transaction Ã©lectronique du marchÃ© Ã©lectronique marocain double tous les ans (actuellement de 70 millions de $).


2- Une bancarisation en hausse :
Un accroissement des pratiques monÃ©taires avec lâ€™augmentation du nombre des cartes bancaires en circulation, qui ont 

dÃ©passÃ© le seuil de 6,5 millions de cartes sous les labels Visa, MasterCard et CMI. 
Selon les statistiques du CMI, le volume de transaction bancaire a Ã©tÃ© multipliÃ© par 2,4 % en passant de 277.000 transactions contre 115.000 pour les six premiers mois de lâ€™annÃ©e 2010. 

3- Une augmentation rÃ©guliÃ¨re du nombre de site eCommerce : Le nombre de sites B2C a augmentÃ© de 30% en 2011 et les estimations d""Ã©volutions sont trÃ¨s optimistes pour les annÃ©es Ã  venir.

4- Lâ€™amÃ©lioration de la confiance numÃ©rique comme prioritÃ© nationale :
Des initiatives nationales sont en cours dâ€™exÃ©cution pour amÃ©liorer la confiance numÃ©rique dâ€™ici 2013 (cf. stratÃ©gie nationale pour la sociÃ©tÃ© de lâ€™information et de lâ€™Ã©conomie numÃ©rique): 
- Initiative 1 : Mettre Ã  niveau et renforcer le cadre lÃ©gislatif.
- Initiative 2 : Mettre en place les structures organisationnelles appropriÃ©es.
- Initiative 3 : Promouvoir et sensibiliser les acteurs de la sociÃ©tÃ© Ã  la sÃ©curitÃ© des systÃ¨mes dâ€™information.","Nous avons effectuÃ© une Ã©tude de l""historique de l""evolution du marchÃ© Ã©lectronique dans les pays occidentaux.

The only thing required from the hosts is to plan what they will cook for their families for a week in advance then publish their (meal plans) on [Shared-Meal] to be viewed by meal buyers (the guests). The guest selection of a meal can be based on her/his taste, availability date, the host profile, the place profile, and even shared interests! When the guest confirms a reservation, the host will only extend the planned meal to be enough for his family and for the guest. The guest share of the meal can either be sent to him through a delivery service provider to his location or it can be served in the host place where both (the host and the guest) can meet to have the planned meal and to share a mutual conversation about a topic that interests both of them.

1- Arabic travel forums (example: http://travel.maktoob.com/vb - http://www.sfari.com/forums/ ) :
Pros:
The main competitors in this market, one of richest sources for Arabic travel content created by users.
Cons:
The classical method of showing the data in the forums but obstacles for user to find & obtain the information he needs from other person trip report, user needs to read too many pages with too many unnecessary replies from people who comment, for example you need to read from to 15 to 23 page as an average -for each trip report- to obtain the information you want from one person trip report he shared in the forum !.
however GoEjaza is different ?
GoEjaza platform overcomes these obstacles & make it easy for both ( user who share his trip report & user who want to benefit from this story) to easy share the information about his trip in a new effective way.

2-International review and planning sites like :
(examples: www.igougo.com - www.tripadvisor.com )
Pros:
Organized content & reviews regarding hotels or restaurants or tourism destinations
Cons:
- The content in these websites is in English.
- Majority of users of these websites are not from the region. This obviously appears in lack of Arabic users using these websites & explain large number of visitors & users of Arabic travel forums because it""s the only platform available to Arabic users to share their travel experience.
however Goejaza is different ?
First: we build goejaza.com for people who searches for original travel content by Arabic users having similar culture

cons:
- no information about travel destination ... show only information about hotels, with minority presence of user reviews.

5-	Trucking contractors: Contractors are specialized in on type of tucking service. They will have more flexibility in serving customers with using their owned trucks. Yet, they donâ€™t offer value added service offered by KLoad (such as document management/reporting). In addition, their service is not reliable because of lack of access to a wide range of truck owners. 
6-	Transportation management solutions providers (TMS). KLoad offered as SAAS (software as a service) is much lower in cost and implementation/training time than TMS. In addition, we offer location information about trucks and shipments. 
7-	Large trucking companies. Own less that 3% of trucks. Most of large trucking companies act as freight forwarders and use their fleet to serve their clients. 
Indirect competitors, Freight forwarders: Most of ports freight trucking is done via Freight forwards who offer clearance and door to door transportation to clients. KLoad short term strategy is to offer its service to class A&B freight forwarders where we can keep competitive rates and sell value added service.

1-Reduce final product cost: reducing transportation cost will reflect on final product cost. Cost reduction will make the product more competitive locally and in the international market. 
2- Reduce CO2 emission: Road transport consumes 30% of Egypt subsidized fuel and emits 28 million ton of CO2 per year. Increasing the truck productivity will reduce the amount of emitted CO2 and wasted fuel consumed by empty travelling trucks. 
4-Improve road safety: Trucks cause 40% of road accident in Egypt, a major cause of accidents is poor maintenance specially tires (Flat tires cause 20% of accidents). Increasing the economic productivity of vehicles will help owners (90% of trucks are owned by individuals) to spend on regular truck maintenance

4-	 Trucking brokers: KLoad will have the advantage of access to the location information of a big number of trucks. In addition, shippers will have instant online access to KLoad to communicate their trucking needs.
5-	Trucking contractors: Contractors are specialized in on type of tucking service. They will have more flexibility in serving customers with using their owned trucks. Yet, they donâ€™t offer value added service offered by KLoad (such as document management/reporting). In addition, their service is not reliable because of lack of access to a wide range of truck owners. 
6-	Transportation management solutions providers (TMS). KLoad offered as SAAS (software as a service) is much lower in cost and implementation/training time than TMS. In addition, we offer location information about trucks and shipments. 
7-	Large trucking companies. Own less that 3% of trucks. Most of large trucking companies act as freight forwarders and use their fleet to serve their clients. 
Indirect competitors, Freight forwarders: Most of ports freight trucking is done via Freight forwards who offer clearance and door to door transportation to clients. KLoad short term strategy is to offer its service to class A&B freight forwarders where we can keep competitive rates and sell value added service.  
","Linking trucks to available load via KLoad will have a significant impact in the following areas:
1-Reduce final product cost: reducing transportation cost will reflect on final product cost. Cost reduction will make the product more competitive locally and in the international market. 
2- Reduce CO2 emission: Road transport consumes 30% of Egypt subsidized fuel and emits 28 million ton of CO2 per year. Increasing the truck productivity will reduce the amount of emitted CO2 and wasted fuel consumed by empty travelling trucks. 
4-Improve road safety: Trucks cause 40% of road accident in Egypt, a major cause of accidents is poor maintenance specially tires (Flat tires cause 20% of accidents). Increasing the economic productivity of vehicles will help owners (90% of trucks are owned by individuals) to spend on regular truck maintenance
",,"Sustain a development team for 1.5 year (36,000 USD)
Build company website/corporate identity (3,000 USD)
Building marketing/training material (3:000 USD)
","Heavy trucks travel empty for 70-80% of return trips. The low performance of heavy trucks results in higher transportation cost due to the fuel, oil and tires wasted during the empty travel. 
15% of the trucks is Egyptâ€™s 500,000 truck are heavy trucks. The heavy trucking fleet transport 60% of the estimated 450 million ton of freight in Egypt. 
The transportation cost can be lowered by 30% if information about truck location and available loads are available. 
KLoad innovation comes from offering the following:
1- Location based service: Using Cell ID/GPS tracking to link trucks to available loads.
2- On demand TMS: Providing a low cost and easy to use Transportation Management System for small and medium enterprises. 
3- Mobile access: Providing mobile interface to drivers/truck owners to allow easy communication in addition to the desktop interface.
",,,,,,,,,,"KLoad will charge a 10% commission and administration fees paid by truck owners.  Our target in Y13 to transport 300,000 ton with expected revenue 150,000 USD. This would be increased by 100% in Y14 and then a 30% year growth to reach revenue of 650,000 USD in 5 years.
 Other major revenue s source will be selling value added service to corporate using a freemium model. Our target in 5 years is to reach 1000 corporate subscriber with gross revenue of 1 million USD. 
",1,NULL,0,0,,,"1-Personal experience: Karim & Hani owns a truck for 6 month. 50% of the time our truck was empty. If the truck had loads on return trips that would have reduced the price of transportation by 30%
2- Several studies have recommended the need for an information system that links trucks to available loads (USAID sponsored study in 1999 and a recent study by the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA), March 2012)
*Misr National Transport Study, Jica, March 2012
*Reducing Transport Cost of Egyptâ€™s Exports, USAID, 1999
","KLoad : connecting trucks to loads 
KLoad is a location based transportation management system (TMS) that connects trucks to available loads. Shipper uses an online company account to place their shipment orders. Using location based technology and available trucks details; KLoad will be able to locate trucks nearest to the shipment and directs the driver through mobile communication to the shipment.   
 KLoad will offer other value added service such as document management, shipment tracking, and history reports, and billing information to clients.

The psychometric test assesses applicantsâ€™ business acumen, personality traits, abilities and attitudes. Each applicant will receive a score (similar to a credit score) and companies will have the freedom to decide on which range they are willing to accept. Using psychometrics reduces the risks associated with hiring recent graduates with no professional experience. It also enables companies to identify applicants that fit their companiesâ€™ culture and hence, have a better chance of succeeding at their job. As a result, companies will reduce turnover and spend less on developmental programs.   ",,"Talent Acquisition "

Naturally Wasla.com will have a lot of competitors as it is a website on the internet that providing same as other competitors a page for a huge database but the only differences from the other competitors is the focusing of the database and the high quality control presented in the network of the website. So here in this section, there is a spot on Wasla.com competitors and what differentiate Wasla.com service from others.
Primary-Direct competitors:
Main competitors are normal search engines (E.g Google, Yahoo, Bing, Msn).
As for Google or other search engines they lack reliability and list the results according to the number of viewers that provide weak image about the business quality, and it list a lot of irrelevant results as well as wasting a lot of time and effort to get specific company through search a massive database with billions of inputs .Beside that if the user is specific with the search keywords still he will have to go through huge results list. Therefore, it didnâ€™t provide reliable results which will decrease the accuracy or the results.
Indirect Competitors:
Websites offering similar services as (Alibaba and Tamkeen) representing the main secondary competitors for Wasla.com. Alibaba and Tamkeen are website that are competing Wasla.com globally.
For Tamkeen is a website that is totally different from Wasla.com network. It is only same as Wasla.com in the point of dealing with the SME""s in Egypt. But Tamkeen have a different way than Wasla.com as dealing with the SME""s in Egypt in a developmental way and also working with them in a detailed staff or help the SME""s from their scratch to their launch.
For Alibaba is a website that includes transactions of buying, selling, and outsourcing. They are contradicting to Wasla.com focus which is a network of integrated, huge database for the benefit of SME""s in Egypt. Ali Baba is a family of Internet-based businesses, which operates the leading global e-commerce platform for small businesses around the world. In June 30, 2012, the platform had 29.4 million registered users from more than 240 countries and regions and showcased 2.5 million supplier storefronts.
Alibaba although it provides kind of similar service, still it lacks a lot of what differentiate Wasla.com service than any other website. As its ranking based on seniority on the website and it donâ€™t guarantee the high quality of companies that recognize our services than any other competitors and furthermore it donâ€™t allow members to review other companies or give their feedback about the transactions it did through the website which hinder their communication with their customers. In addition to that, wasla.com offers much special services for its customers that guarantee the delivering of a unique value for our customers and ensure their loyalty.
Other competitors:
Other competitors could be normal brokers but those brokers have limited network and canâ€™t cover all fields. Plus, they have inaccurate data about the companyâ€™s quality and performance. Furthermore, brokers could have unethical decisions that are avoided by our website.
Competitive position:
No other business in Egypt focuses exclusively on the quality of the information that can be needed by the SME""s in their business field or integrating them in a one website on the internet. This benefit or this competitive advantage can provide the website a high attention getter to it from different levels of companies or sectors in the Egyptian market.
The search engines as Google, Yahoo, and msn that are competing all around the world. But for Wasla.com website after the first 5 years of operation in the market, it will be presented in Cairo but with an easier way to the SME""S around Egypt .Due to that Wasla.com will reach to their specific information in its integrated network for different databases. In addition to that,Wasla.com website will offer a high quality database that integrate different information that are in a need by the SME""S .Then Wasla.com will be expanded in another three countries after the 5 years of operations.
For Wasla.com the different search engines and the other websites in the market for the same purpose of giving the internet users a huge database for different information are shaping a huge competition for Wsal.com in the market .And these competitors also are profitable in the market and successful. But Wasla.com has an integrated network with a competitive advantage over the other competitors, which as it was mentioned the integration and the focusing in different business sectors that will be needed by the SME""s in their business. All these information will be in a one place with a high quality control.",,,"we will start implementing our project and launch the 1st stage on Egypt before expanding.","The opportunity of Wasla arise from understanding the our market as SMEs represent about 80% of the value added business in Egypt with 80% of the total offered jobs in the job market. So this huge market needs services to support its gross and achievements. And as one of the main problems face any SME in Egypt and many other countries is finding trustable committed suppliers and partners especially if they couldnâ€™t access the market of big suppliers due to the high costs or harsh competition with barriers of entry to those suppliers. That was the main reason to think about Wasla.com.",,,,,,,,,,,1,NULL,0,0,,,,"""Wasala .com will try to make spaces closer than it appears, in only one click through one Web from Your personal Laptop.By bringing and integrating different suppliers partners in different sectors for the benefit of the small and medium enterprises in Egypt .That will save time, money and guarantee the quality of the information. BY that it will have the long run impact for a progress to the country""s economic development"".
Wasla.com is a website created for SMEs in Egypt that lack networks and search for good new partner and better offers. Here, you can get trusted connections for rated companies with 100% secured online transactions. Highly experienced Quality management teams will be outsourced to rate the performance of the companies to allow it to be member on our website and legal advisors supervise the performed transactions as well and can review the contracts between parties as third trusted partner.

The company plans to focus in the first few months to verify its technology commercially and towards this goal, the company would focus on marketing in local (MENA) region, where it is easier to get first costumers through local networks.
",,"Competition:

The company faces competition from all solar technology companies, whether CPV or PV companies. The company focuses mainly on bringing cheap CPV to roofs, which most of CPV companies canâ€™t. Current CPV roof technologies are not cheap and not adequate for non conqrete roofs, one company managed to bring light weight CPV system but only with 21% conversion efficiency and at cost.

CPV installation for 2012 is close to .1 GW and to grow to 1.2 GW in 2016.
Two key factors made CPV tech. come short to PV in installation are:

1.	Price
2.	Ground mounting necessary for most of the CPV systems while fig (3) and fig (4) shows that the majority of PV installations are not ground mounted 

â€¢	And our system manage to solve this two problems to expand with a CPV system into the PV market. 
","We provide cheap solar technology with high conversion efficiency (about 30%, better than 97% tech. in the market).


We designed a new (non-tracking ) Concentrated PV (CPV)system. Our concentrator has the ability to concentrate sun from any angle, removing the need for expensive, heavy and huge tracker and mounting structure used by current CPV systems which use ordinary convex lens or mirrors. It Brings cheap light weight CPV system to the market that can be installed on roofs unlike current CPV technologies.

same thing ""A lot of falsified goods"" Medicine, food,
cars spare parts. you name it !! customers are always
suspicious about the goods they buy. One good
example is the electrical accessories market in Egypt
where brands like Siemens and GE suffer from cheap
grey market products which may cause fire in customer
place. Saudia Arabia , UAE, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco
and Jordan are all suffering the same issues.
Wherever there are falsified goods in the market
""Assly"" can make a real difference by offering secure and reliable service that can protect against falsification. 
For the businesses like pharmaceuticals and spare parts manufactures and distributors such service will mean less profit losses and more fund to spend on research and development.",,,"The falsification of goods; specially medicine and car spare parts is a huge problem in MENA region. Estimates of counterfeited medicine in Egypt only is estimated at 3 Billion EGP per year (source http://www.elshaab.org/thread.php?ID=39962)
Jordan is another country that suffers the same problem with 10 Billion Dinar (Source http://www.alfanonline.com/show_news.aspx?nid=18814&pg=4)
All around the world the market of falsified goods including medicine is estimated between 70 to 120 Billion US$ !!
In Africa there are 700,000 death per year due to falsified medicine.
The number of people who die due to falsified car spare parts is huge as well.
Watching this video can show how severe is this in our region.

you-go model so they pay for each code that they print
on their packages. Primary price is estimated at 0.25
EGP per code. Developing a CRM system for the
manufactures based on the fact that the service
database contains their customer contacts already can
be another source of revenue.
If the loses are 1.2 B EGP yearly and Assly system can
return 10% of that(120M) at the cost of 10M only then
it will make a lot of sense for the manufactures !

Primary price is estimated at 0.25 EGP per code.
Another source of revenue can be offering the service
as a premium SMS for the end users.
Expected revenue are to sell 1 million code by first year
(250K EGP) and by third year of operation 5 million
codes (1 million EGP). Expanding to other countries will
triple those numbers. ",1,NULL,0,0,,,"Assly had proofed the concept on many trials with
potential customers like Bridgestone agent in Egypt.

to market the service of checking genuine goods. The
company plans to be the first and most trusted
company offering this service in MENA region. The
brand ""Genuine"" or ""Asly""  should always become the first word that come to customers mind when they want to check how
genuine is any product. Through the use of easy to
remember short code ""9104""; it will be published

Experts rate Saudi roads as among the worldâ€™s most dangerous. Arab News, [online] 8 November. Available at: < http://www.arabnews.com/saudi-arabia/experts-rate-saudi-roads-among-world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous> [Accessed 26 January 2013].)",http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX4H9RHSIWw,,,,,,"There is a regional demand for cheap innovative solutions for traffic accidents. The business is very scalable because it can satisfy this demand with little changes made to the software. Moreover, these changes and tweaks to the software that will make it suitable for other markets are few (mainly maps and interface language). The few changes indicate that there will be an increase in profits without a proportionate increase in costs.",,,"selling the software, subscriptions to the software, and the after sales services.",1,NULL,0,0,,,"The first step was to investigate traffic accidents reduction solutions implemented in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states. The solutions were assessed by comparing the number of traffic accidents, related number of fatalities/injuries in different years. All these numbers had an increasing trend, while the solutions implemented failed constantly. Moreover, most of the solutions were legislations and laws which produced general unconcentrated efforts to deal with the problem.","TARS collects traffic accidents data, analyse it, and help implementing and evaluating its solutions. TARS will have a smart phone app that traffic officers use to report traffic accidents that they handle (Reporting locations, times, number of injuries, and deaths). The smart phone app will crowd source the data collection process creating a huge mine of data for the software to analyse. The software will produce an interactive map with each cluster of accidents represented as a point. The colour of the each point represents the frequency of accidents (red for high, orange for medium, and yellow for low). When clicking on any accidents point a profile will appear, containing the pointâ€™s details. The details include its number, status, and historical data. The employees must suggest a solution to reduce the accidents in this point, using data that the software analysed. After inserting the solution, the software starts tracking the change in the rate of accidents, deaths, and injuries in the point. Solutions can be viewed and sorted depending on district, status, and rate of change. This feature enables the traffic department to identify the employees or teams with best/worst solutions, which can become a field of competition. The software will be able to learn from the users and starts recognising patters, which enables it to start suggesting solutions for accident points, or even modifications for current implemented solutions.",,7

*We are doing that through merging 5 things together:
-Physics
-Practical skills
-Technical knowledge
-Interpersonal skills
-Moral lessons

""The 1st letter of every term are the project name (PPTIM)""

*PPTIM consists of 3 arms:
-B2D
-MILE 
-Robot-Khana

*We are trying to apply this concept through 3 different arms, it is the same idea and concept, but the tool is a little bit different in every project.

>>>1st Arm: (B2D ""Born To Discover""), Target age: 8-12

Aim: Help the kids to be more creative, also to take them out of the digital world and put them in the real and practical one; because the life is not ideal as we see in the PCs. All that through an edutainment way, when merging physics, practical skills, technical knowledge, interpersonal skills and moral lessons in an interesting program.


Cause: We believe that investing in the kids is more important than investing in the adults. They are the future builders. Also, their mind are like a white paper, then, if you succeeded in filling this paper with the write words. You will be able to hope for a better world for them.

Description: It""s a program for the age 8-12 Years. Through this program we give them all the skills mentioned before through building robots. This program is divided into a series of workshops. The kids are divided into teams then they begin their work with the help of the instructors. The instructors give them the knowledge and the skills in a practical way through building their own robots using the CORDian kits.

Tools:
-Kits provided by CORD, it contains materials that we can find around us and we always see daily like: rulers, rubbers, syringes, hoses and much more. The idea is how to merge and connect these materials and make functional robots. These kits are categorized into families and every family into levels. These kits help the instructors through the program. The R&D department in CORD is the responsible department for developing these kits.
-Also the well-trained instructors are the human resource.


>>>2nd Arm: (MILE ""Making Inventors Life Easier""), Target age: 12-16

Aim: As it is shown in the name of the project, making inventors life easier.

Cause: Widening the range of using the CORDian kits to make the largest segment take benefit from the idea.

Description: We consider the kits itself as a separate project; these kits can be sold in the stores, they can be independent with the help of the included manual, which contains the steps you should do to build the robot using the kit. It doesn""t need a course or a program in this case and for that age.

Tools: Only the CORDian Kits.

>>>3rd Arm: (Robot-Khana), Target age: 16-24
""Khana is the pronunciation of a Turkish word means Place""

Aim: Helping the youth to better understand the physics and the technical knowledge they have learned in a practical way. Also developing their creativity, technical skills and interpersonal skills as well. All that to make them be able to take the better decision, be more productive in their lives and change their societies to better ones.

Cause: We also believe in investing in the youth; because they are the builders of the present or the near future.

Description: It""s Robots Competitions that held in different places like colleges, high schools, clubs or any other youth community. The participants take their knowledge from open sessions provided by CORD then they participate to make the competition""s mission. It""s a non-profitable project, as it is also a volunteering activity. It""s like a student to student activity in different communities managed by CORD, we provide an organizational manual that helps the passionate students to start their CORDian branch in their college or school. Step by step from establishing the branch till making the competition through the different phases like: teams registration, competition""s design, book of rules design, open sessions, robots testing, .. etc.

Objective: To make sustainable CORDian branches -Which are volunteering activities, non-profitable and from students to students- in different youth communities all over Egypt, then all over Africa and The Arab World.

Tools:
-The organizational manual provided by CORD which contains all the info. needed by the organizers
-The open sessions provided by CORDian instructors which contains the technical material needed by the participants
-The CORDian kits provided by CORD
-The sponsors that give the fund support to these student activities



*Note: The common thing between the three projects is ""the CORDian Kits"", which is our main tool, it is also in continuous development.

Il existe 8 packs : 

-Pack0 (vitrine en ligne) : Il sâ€™agit de la possibilitÃ© dâ€™afficher ses produits ou services sur sa page avec les informations qui leur sont liÃ©es (photo, prix, quantitÃ© disponible, description, etc). Ce pack permet aux clients de lâ€™organisme de commander online mais ne peuvent payer quâ€™en offline. 

-Pack1 (paiement en ligne): Ce pack donne la possibilitÃ© aux clients dâ€™un organisme de payer en ligne. Si la mise Ã  jour de la quantitÃ© de produits nâ€™est pas automatique, le client doit rÃ©server le produit avant de payer (car il y a possibilitÃ© de rupture de stock avant la mise Ã  jour sur la page du commerÃ§ant). Une fois que le produit est rÃ©servÃ©, le client peut payer.

-Pack2 (CrÃ©ation dâ€™une base de donnÃ©es des produits) : Certains commerÃ§ants nâ€™ont pas de systÃ¨me numÃ©risÃ© de gestion de flux financiers et matÃ©riels. EasyPay peut leur proposer dâ€™en crÃ©er un avec des moyens simples et des prix compÃ©titifs (tablette ou Smartphone, application dÃ©veloppÃ©e ad hoc, systÃ¨me de gestion et dâ€™Ã©tiquetage des produits Ã  base de code QR)

-Pack3 (IntÃ©gration de la base de donnÃ©es des produits) : Si le commerÃ§ant utilise dÃ©jÃ  un systÃ¨me de gestion de stock avec une base de donnÃ©es des produits, il est possible de la connecter Ã  la page du commerÃ§ant. Ainsi, la disponibilitÃ© et le nombre de produits seront mis Ã  jour automatiquement.

-Pack4 (Assistance technique/graphique) : Si le commerÃ§ant nâ€™a pas les photos de ses produits, EasyPay peut lui proposer de faire appel Ã  une Ã©quipe de photographes qui lâ€™aideront Ã  produire des photos de qualitÃ© Ã  mettre sur sa vitrine en ligne. Elle peut aussi lui proposer une formation technique pour la crÃ©ation et la gestion de sa vitrine.

-Pack5 (Flux dâ€™informations) : Le commerÃ§ant peut choisir dâ€™envoyer un flux dâ€™informations sur lequel pourront sâ€™abonner les clients intÃ©ressÃ©s par ses produits. Ainsi, les clients seront informÃ©s des nouveautÃ©s dÃ¨s la mise Ã  jour de la vitrine sans avoir Ã  la consulter.

-Pack6 (Livraison) : Lorsquâ€™un commerÃ§ant vend un produit, EasyPay peut lui proposer de rÃ©cupÃ©rer la marchandise et de la livrer Ã  lâ€™adresse de livraison choisie par lâ€™acheteur.

-Pack7 (Paiement par carte bancaire) : Si le commerÃ§ant le souhaite, EasyPay peut lâ€™aider Ã  intÃ©grer une solution de paiement par carte bancaire en utilisant un terminal de paiement sur Smartphone ou tablette. ",1,NULL,0,0,,,"Ã‰tude rÃ©alisÃ©e par le ministÃ¨re du commerce tunisien.

EnquÃªte auprÃ¨s des organismes pour mieux connaitre leurs besoins spÃ©cifiques.","EasyPay est une sociÃ©tÃ© de service pour les organismes qui projettent de se lancer dans le e-commerce ou qui ont besoin dâ€™offrir Ã  leurs clients la possibilitÃ© de payer en ligne. Ces organismes peuvent Ãªtre des commerÃ§ants, des associations, des prestataires de services, des universitÃ©s privÃ©es, des centres de formations, des organisateurs dâ€™Ã©vÃ¨nements, etc. 

La plus grande valeur ajoutÃ©e de lâ€™entreprise EasyPay sera le site web www.easypay.tn. Câ€™est un site sur lequel tout organisme pourra ouvrir un compte et crÃ©er une vitrine en ligne dans laquelle il proposera ses produits et/ou services. Les clients de cet organisme iront se connecter sur ce site et ils auront la possibilitÃ© dâ€™acheter le produit en ligne. La transaction se fera sur une plateforme unique commune Ã  tous les organismes. Lâ€™argent sera donc versÃ© sur le compte bancaire dâ€™EasyPay et cette derniÃ¨re le transmettra Ã  qui de droit.

Lorsquâ€™un acheteur est intÃ©ressÃ© par un produit, deux cas sont possibles : 
Cas1. Le produit est disponible immÃ©diatement. Dans ce cas,  lâ€™acheteur peut directement cliquer sur Â« Payer Â». Si le vendeur veut mettre en ligne des produits qui sont disponibles immÃ©diatement, il doit sâ€™engage Ã  les livrer quand le client paie.
Cas2. Le produit doit Ãªtre commandÃ© avant dâ€™Ãªtre payÃ© en ligne. Dans ce cas, la procÃ©dure est la suivante : 
- lâ€™acheteur clique sur le bouton Â« Commander Â»
- le vendeur est notifiÃ© quâ€™un client a commandÃ© le produit. 
- le vendeur clique sur Â«Jâ€™accepte la commandeÂ» ou Â«Je refuse la commandeÂ»
- Si le vendeur accepte la commande, lâ€™acheteur peut payer et le vendeur a lâ€™obligation de livrer.

Par ailleurs, EasyPay permettra de rassurer les acheteurs et les vendeurs Ã  distance. En gÃ©nÃ©ral,  les acheteurs ne veulent pas payer Ã  distance avant de recevoir le produit parce quâ€™ils nâ€™ont aucune garantie que le vendeur va le livrer. Les vendeurs, quant Ã  eux, ne veulent pas livrer avant dâ€™Ãªtre payÃ©s parce quâ€™ils nâ€™ont aucune garantie que lâ€™acheteur paiera. Il y a donc besoin dâ€™un tiers de confiance. Le principe d""utilisation du tiers de confiance est le suivant :

1. L""acheteur envoie son paiement Ã  EasyPay et reÃ§oit un code secret
2. Le vendeur expÃ©die le produit Ã  l""acheteur
3. EasyPay est informÃ© de la rÃ©ception du produit par la saisie du code secret (cette saisie est faite soit par l""acheteur soit par le vendeur)
4. Le paiement est alors versÃ© au vendeur",,"Service / E-commerce"

We will speak with the UNRWA due to high gunfire in those areas and we will help the authorities there to catch the shooters. Then we will start our campaign in hot areas where gunfire is at its highest, mainly in Tripoli, then spread across Lebanon. We will attempt to spread in the middle east region in our first year.
We need a minimum of 3 active users in a radius of 1.5km during the day and 3km radius during the night for the application to work.",,"On a Global scale; our indirect competition is â€œShotSpotterâ€ (based U.S.A). We share the same goal but their course of action is not similar to ours on many fundamental levels.
ShotSpotter uses highly-developed sensors that are placed at variable- determined locations to detect shootings and sources of gunfire. This technology is sold at very high rates ($40,000 to $60,000 per square mile per year) , and is under the control of the client directly (the government). The problem is being solved but on a monopolistic level; the people and media donâ€™t have access to it because of its high cost.

On a Local scale : Our indirect competition is â€œMa2tou3aâ€, an application that reports traffic jams, shootings, protests and so on. The problem is that itâ€™s not as specific as us (providing us with a competitive advantage of differentiation and responsiveness) and it reports when itâ€™s publically known whatâ€™s going on (Meaning not within a short-time frame).

The idea of this project came from the need to healthy individuals to have a guide that helps them find out the exact need of their bodies from calories each day, and not only that, because many available programs can do so. This program is going to suggest a meal plan that matches the amount of calories calculated for each person. 
The program will also tell the user if they are in the range of healthy weight, underweight, overweight or obese phase; according to that the program will either increase the amount of calories needed (if underweight) or decrease the amount of calories needed (if overweight) to facilitate further weight loss, and encourage reaching a healthier weight. All of the calculations in the program are based on scientific equations, and are approved by the World Health organization (WHO).
The program is going to ask the user to provide weight, height, gender, age and physical activity level. According to the numbers given, some calculations are going to be done, and the program will provide the user with the amount of calories that needs to be consumed per day, number of servings from each food group and will also suggest some meal plans.",,7

I have 13 years of experience in software development, including development, architecting and management experience. I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from LAU (Lebanese American University) 

I think that my most valuable skills are my ability to quickly grasp and assimilate any new technology and the ability to tackle any problem and solve it. The latest problem that showcases these 2 abilities was to devise a DDoS defense mechanism for an online poker room and enabled it to fend off massive attacks of 3Gb/s. I also worked on improving the shuffler for that poker room.

Technically, what I bring to the game is a considerable architecting and development experience plus machine learning and AI experience. I love machine learning and AI and I am a firm believer that these disciplines will be a major force in the next evolution of the web. ",,"Bank and big retailers in the MENA area.",,"We are not aware of any company in the market providing such a service. ","If the project is successful we think that it will generate around 15 to 20 jobs. Jobs that includes software developers, customer support, sales and project managers.",,"These are estimates and per year. 

Office Rent + Lawyer Fees + Accountant Fees + Electricity + Internet = 25K

3 Senior Software Developers = 90K

We need at least 3 years of funding for this project to have a chance of survival. 
115K per year x 3 = 345K

During the first year we will find and implement the first solution for the first client. During the second year we should be able to get more clients and by the 3rd we should be able to generate income to support the operations of the startup. After the third we should reach a point where the generated income should attract more investors and will allow to grow the startup to a full fledged company. 

","Let give examples instead. These examples are extracted from a special report by The Economist on big data (Data, data everywhere - Feb 27, 2010)
* In 2004 WalMart peered into its mammoth databases and noticed  that  before  a  hurricane  struck, there was a run on Â‡fashlights and batteries,  as might be expected; but also on PopTarts, a sugary American breakfast snack.

* Best Buy, a retailer, found that 7% of its customers accounted for 43% of its sales, so it reorganised its stores to concentrate on those customersâ€™ needs.  

*Airline yield management improved because analytical techniques uncovered the best predictor that a passenger would actually catch a flÂ‡ight he had booked: that he had ordered a vegetarian meal.

It is these kinds of insights that we want to provide to banks and big retailers.
","Not available.",,,,,,"This is how we envision it. At first we will build custom made solutions then we plan to use the expertise collected to create a generic data solution available online that allows the SME to have the same power of insight as the big companies. 
Imagine for a second a big town retailer in Lebanon who just wants to understand how to increase his sales. He can simply connect his data our service and use it to provide him the insights we got from other retailers. In other words we have repackaged and sold him the intelligence of the big retailer. One such insight might be that he has a large demand for a certain product and we know from other retailers that that product goes very well with another product he does not have in his shop.

So we think we should be able to grow from simple software service provider to a region wide software as a service provider where our client will use our online service instead of our on site expertise. ",,0$,"Banks and big retailers in the MENA area but we don""t have any statistic on the size of that market.",1,NULL,0,0,,,"We are planning to experiment with 2 business models:
Make money out of the profit or savings we are generating for our clients. The service will be offered for free and we only want a portion of the saving or profit the client will be making. This approach gives a better chance to keep the ownership of the insights we will be finding.

Sell the solution as standalone software solution.","The first idea of this startup was to use Machine Learning and AI in order attack the information overload problem. The result was an app called the Morning Book (for more info go to http://www.themorningbook.com) but we were never able to get any traction with this first product so we thought that our best approach is to pivot and apply the things we learned to business data instead. 

Our aim for this new product is to combine artificial intelligence, statistics and art to transform reams of financial and economic data into gripping stories. In short we want the data to tell its story.

This product is not yet built but we have proof through the MorningBook app that we are able to transform a raging river of information that is Twitter into a docile stream. To achieve that goal we needed a way to make the computer â€œunderstandâ€ so that it can filter and sort. Understand that in some contexts ""Apple"" means the computer company not the fruit. Understand that in some contexts â€œsickâ€ might denote a positive sentiment. Neur0s was able to create an algorithm that allows computers to ""understand"". This algorithm is based on a mathematical way that allows computers to work with an intuitive, generalized idea of similarity.

Through our experience in the MorningBook we were able to amass a lot of know-how on converting data into meaningful stories and we want the chance to apply these techniques and technologies to data warehouses of banks and of retail stores.  

At first we will build custom made solutions then we will use this expertise to abstract away as much of the technical complexity as possible and create a product that will put the power of big data into the hands of any business user.","Cultural: We fear the banks will not let us read and process their data however we hope the big retailer are less protective of that data. 

Reputation: Being a startup does not project an image of stability and confidence so we fear future clients will be hesitant to commit.

","Moroccan people are known to be familiar with gardens and green environment. The gardening field it is deeply related to Moroccan Culture, and this can be noticed by the availability of green spaces in Moroccan homes. However; people are still obliged to use conventional ways in creating and maintaining their green spaces. Thus, we provide our clients with a unique service and modern approach via our website to develop beautiful and functional gardens; to create something that lasts a lifetime, and brings an everlasting joy to our clients. Our focus is not only on the big spaces but also the smallest ones that can be converted to a balcony garden, where there are plenty of designs and ideas to choose from. In P.G, we work closely with our clients to produce imaginative and practical designs. We never seek to impose ideas. First we discuss our client preferences and needs of his green space, then we produce an individual design perfectly suited to his garden. 
The gardening industry in Morocco grows at a very slow pace and needs more investments to boost this industry. People still use the traditional ways in gardening and in the best case they hire unprofessional workers to do the job. Thus the quality is noticeably poor and people not complaining because the alternatives are very rare. Add to that, people in Morocco are not used to spend a lot of time in designing, due to the busy lifestyle. On our website we are providing solutions for these problems with reasonable prices.",,,,,,,"  â€œOur vision is to be the leaders of the Gardening industry in Morocco and North Africa.â€",,,"

","The goal of our project is the development of a noncoherent solution, implemented as a system-on-chip ASIC, for 100 Gigabit Ethernet (100G) fiber
optic communications. Internet traffic is expected to grow at a 34% CAGR between 2009 and 2014. Traffic growth is projected to exceed available network capacity in the near future, forcing network operators to deploy new solutions. The solution has to be low-cost, bandwidth-efficient, and compatible with existing optical networks infrastructure. This proposal makes it possible to develop a 100Gbps mixed-signal system-on-chip that will serve as key component within a cost-efficient noncoherent direct detection 100G fiber optic transceiver. The system-on-chip consists of fast data converters (ADCs &DACs), RF modulators/demodulators, tunable filters, variable-gain amplifiers, drivers, and a sophisticated signal-processing digital core. Its functions are 1) pre-process electrical signals prior to their transmission over the optical fiber, 2) process optically received signals to remove fiber distortions (such as chromatic & polarization-mode dispersion, nonlinear impairments) and recover the transmitted data. In contrast to competing coherent solutions which require a multitude of optical drivers, modulators, photodetectors, and coherent-optics components, the proposed solution uses novel techniques which only require a single modulator/driver and a single photodetector.

Our highly diverse, cross-disciplinary team possess in-house IC development expertise, DSP, high-speed module design, software & and system know-how. This diverse background sets us apart from our competitors who tend to be device/component oriented lacking IC and overall system know-how. ","The broader impact/commercial potentials of this project are 1) the potential replacement of millions of short-reach and metro 10Gbps ports -already deployed worldwide- by bandwidth-efficient 100G transceivers, and 2) enabling green-field deployment of 100G ports over newly installed fiber. ",,"Development team - Salaries & Wages: $125,000
Travel Expenses(vendors/clients vists): $4,000
Lab equipment (100G Spectrum analyzer, 100G BERT, 100G DCA scopes, component evaluation boards): $20,000

Total amount: $150,000
","The goal of our project is the development of a noncoherent solution, implemented as a system-on-chip ASIC, for 100 Gigabit Ethernet (100G) fiber
optic communications. Internet traffic is expected to grow at a 34% CAGR between 2009 and 2014. Traffic growth is projected to exceed available network capacity in the near future, forcing network operators to deploy new solutions. The solution has to be low-cost, bandwidth-efficient, and compatible with existing optical networks infrastructure. This proposal makes it possible to develop a 100Gbps mixed-signal system-on-chip that will serve as key component within a cost-efficient noncoherent direct detection 100G fiber optic transceiver. The system-on-chip consists of fast data converters (ADCs &DACs), RF modulators/demodulators, tunable filters, variable-gain amplifiers, drivers, and a sophisticated signal-processing digital core. Its functions are 1) pre-process electrical signals prior to their transmission over the optical fiber, 2) process optically received signals to remove fiber distortions (such as chromatic & polarization-mode dispersion, nonlinear impairments) and recover the transmitted data. In contrast to competing coherent solutions which require a multitude of optical drivers, modulators, photodetectors, and coherent-optics components, the proposed solution uses novel techniques which only require a single modulator/driver and a single photodetector.
",,,,,,,"According to Infonetics Research, optical transceiver market is expected to grow to $2.14 billion by 2014 with 40G/100G ports taking on a significant share. Moreover, per ATTâ€™s own prediction, â€œâ€¦every 10G lambda installed today will be a 100G lambdaâ€¦â€ (source: IDC June 2009). Forecasts such as these from industry pundits, system vendors and operators alike indicate that 100G deployment is both imminent and massive. Menaraâ€™s solution combines state-of-the-art DSP and RF techniques requiring fewer optical/electrical components as compared with competing coherent solutions. It thus allows for a compact 100G solution that is cost and power efficient (fewer components needed) and enables service providers to simplify their networks and reduce their cost-per-bit while increasing their port density.",,"$15 million","We have customers in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia.

These smart phones are the future of computing devices and could replace many smart devices such as GPS devices, Cameras and PDA. In this work, I propose a smart phones application that using enhanced GPS and GIS technology. This application will be used inside buildings such as malls, hospitals, hotels and universities. We could use GPS enhancement for getting accurate location such as Indoor Positioning System. This application will define and describe these buildings from inside using GPS and GIS technology, and could advertise and market products of these buildings inside the application. These buildings do not have interactive maps that show a very detailed information inside the building. For example, the malls inside KSA only has a very simple maps located inside the maps and give simple information about the shops and does not direct the customer to the shop easily and he must suffer before he could find the shop especially in big malls. I propose a smart phones application that create an interactive map that provide the user with the exact location of the shops inside the malls and give detailed information about every shop such as shop name, shop number, shop opening and closing time, and shop activity, etc... In addition, this application can provide the user with the shop products prices and newest products and indicate if there is a sale on the shop.
The objective of this idea is to save the time of the users inside malls, find the shops easily, and provide them with a very useful information about mallâ€™s shops. In addition, the owner of the shops can market their products inside the application.

Radar and Antenna Basics..Network basics",,"We believe that we have a born global product which will have no geographical barriers. As we mentioned above, we address the market of Aerial geophysical surveying services, NAICS 541360/ SIC 8713. Our first targeted customers are Petroleum & Gas companies for both pipe line as an asset management tool and geological investigation for oil falls, and other governmental bodies including (Ministries of Tourism, Agriculture, and Industry) will be interested in our technologies and services. As we are geographically located in Egypt, we will start by our local market then followed by regional market including North Africa, Gulf Council Countries and the rest of the African content. Then we will go to Europe and the rest of the world.
As mentioned above the GPR air vehicle has a variety of applications and use models in different sectors, solving different client needs with the same technology and application. Regarding only one segment, we have decided to illustrate the details of one of the target markets which, we believe, has high demand especially in Egypt and other African countries. This market is the landmine detection",,"The detector market is likely to be dominated by the metal detector in the short term as it is widely used, its strengths and limitations are well understood, and deminer Standard Operating Procedures and standards are adapted to its use. The market will become more fragmented by the introduction of new technology products, like ours, which meet the differing requirements and expectations of users in different countries.

So, speaking about competitors in EGYPT, there will be the metal detector providers who provide the government with it. those are our main competitors as we are presenting a new technology with a cost effective ""switching cost"".

Our indirect ones are the suppliers. As for our technology, we deal with a few numbers of suppliers.","Safety for deminers!

. We are able to provide our customers with the same final quality they target in a completely safe, fast and reliable solution. With our system, customers can survey/investigate areas they have never been able to reach, thus accomplish tasks that have been impossible to be accomplished before in a timeframe which is not comparable with the traditional alternative solutions. It""s a safe way that protects operators involved in demining activities.  Hitting a buried mine leads to serious injury or even loss of life. The value of investing in GPR technology can easily be realized by eliminating the human element. Putting aside the cost of demining and loss of service, what value can be compared against a human life?!",,"It""ll be the first investment for our Market Product.","Regarding market, our product can address a couple of discovery, mapping and surveying segments, that each serve specific fields. We address Aerial geophysical surveying services, NAICS 541360/ SIC 8713. The mix of convenience, safety and accuracy does not exist inside this segment. Existing solutions involve human resources, thus exposing their lives to danger, or system to malfunction due to rough/ unleveled ground.
In order to show market pain, we will address the landmine detection segment. Contamination by landmines and all other types of unexploded ammunition usually called unexploded ordnance or UXO) is a worldwide problem with enormous humanitarian impact. At least 67 countries are being affected by land mines, but reliable estimates of the area affected worldwide are not readily available. Estimates of the number of mines laid vary widely, from 50 to 150 million. In the mid-1990s, humanitarian demining became a hot topic on the political agenda According to the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling Production and Transfer or Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction (often referred to as the Ottawa Treaty), which entered into force in 1999, all stockpiles of mines should be destroyed within 4 years and all minefields lifted in 10 years.
In addition to antipersonnel mines, sub-munitions such as bomb-lets delivered by air or artillery, multipurpose weapons, and unexploded ordnance should be regarded as mines. These sub-munitions are often more difficult to identify and clear than mines.
""Every 5000 mines cleared one worker will be killed and two workers will be injured by accidental explosions."" Nicolas E. Walsh and Wendy S. Walsh in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization 2003: Using the other common techniques will put 22000 deminer to death and 44000 will be injured besides the additional effects of the antipersonnel mines and the UXO (unexploded ordnance). Autonomous unmanned aerial system becomes a must, as robots become ineffective due to exposure to explosion.
In Egypt, all of our existing problems can be easily tracked to the wasted vast lands that nearly all are expected landmines areas! This was the real motive behind our product at the very beginning; to free Egypt of landmines.
â€œAll existing solutions expose my men to a certain degree of danger.â€ said General Taher Harby, head of engineers division in the Egyptian military, when we first told him about the vision to make our product. â€œIt would be very useful if we could have this ability to make such an accurate and safe detection process.â€ he concluded.
",,,,,,,"There are 120 million mines all over the world. Those create multiple markets as military or private contractors. The areas most affected by land mines include: Egypt (23 million, mostly in border regions); Angola (9-15 million); Iran (16 million); Afghanistan (about 10 million); Iraq (10 million); China (10 million); Cambodia (up to 10 million); Croatia (2 million); Somalia (up to 2 million in the North); Eritrea (1 million); and Sudan (1 million). The ability to enter advanced new products into the detector market will be significantly affected by the price elasticity of the market. Higher priced products at similar market volumes (inelastic market) are more likely if the potential benefits of using the new equipment are significant. A product which could improve the false alarm rate of current metal detectors by a factor of 10 could potentially double the overall clearance rate, resulting in savings of the order of $280k or more per square km. A proportion of such savings could be allocated to increased equipment costs during project budgeting.
The detector market is likely to be dominated by the metal detector in the short term as it is widely used, its strengths and limitations are well understood, and deminer Standard Operating Procedures and standards are adapted to its use. The market will become more fragmented by the introduction of new technology products, like ours, which meet the differing requirements and expectations of users in different countries.We can be The First Mover in alot of countries!.
",,,"We were able to develop our new GPR architecture and air vehicle in a fully integrated functional device with around 12% cost of the cheapest traditional GPR device found in the market. So our new architecture is not just accurate, efficient and effective, it is also economic.

The cost of Removing a mine without knowing its location is 1000$ While the cost while knowing its location is about 30$.!!

In Egypt, For example There are 4.8 billion barrels of oil that cant be accessed because of landmines! Also, there are 13.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas!",1,NULL,0,0,,,"We""ve already marketed the project on Tv and Newspaper and the normal citizen can easily be familiar with our project as we were on alot of popular Tv shows in EGYPT.","A detection device that is highly sophisticated yet simple to operate. A system that is not held in hand, but is operated wirelessly. A seamless scan due to an air vehicle that you need not to worry about. A safe process with no earth or human contact. A map with all key objects (mines, cracks, rocksâ€¦etc.) is finally shown.

The product is based on an innovative radar technology â€”that is Ground penetrating Radar (GPR). It is a geophysical method that uses radar waves to image the subsurface. This method detects the reflected signals from subsurface structures.

Ground-penetrating radar antennas are generally in contact with the ground for the strongest signal strength. For use above the ground, GPR air launched antennas can be used. However, those systems were very large and heavy to the extent they were either fixed in location or installed on a van (bumper level). This rendered the whole process as difficult, very costly and thus impractical. Our product offers the end to the misery through a revolutionary invented architecture. We""ve designed the GPR module to be in no contact with the scanned surface unlike the typical GPR used now. The whole GPR technology is reinvented to over 

the land surface usage through mounting the GPR over an air vehicle providing safety and speed of scan.

Yasir El Nimr - Nawwer CMO
Known to be self-driven, to the point, and having a bird""s-eye view on most topics, I have graduated from the American University of Sharjah in 2010 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering. Last year, I have started my MBA as a part-time student at the University of Wollongong Dubai.

This week, I have quieted my job at GBM (IBM GMSR) as the Software Support Specialist to dedicate myself to Nawwer. At which I have managed a pipeline of software support renewal contracts worth $6M (2012) for top tier customers in 6 branches. Despite my quota of $4M, I have managed to surpass it by more than 50%. Additionally, my achievements are merely double the sales of year 2011. Being the contact point between IBM TSS team, and GBM ITS branch managers and account managers have made me attain management, negotiation, and problem solving skills.

During my university life, I was an adrenaline pumping student. Being a board member at the Computer club, I was responsible for media and public relations in organizing our trips, seminars, and competitions. Bringing in speakers from blue chip companies such as Microsoft and Nvidia was one of our successes. I have interned at the DIFC as a web designer and mentored at GBMâ€™s networking department. Additionally, I have freelanced as a graphic designer for Interactive Group to design posters, banners and invitations for a corporate event. 

As the Chief Marketing Officer at Nawwer, I will be responsible for the online/offline marketing. I will build on my design, PR, and marketing skills to attain website hits, build partnerships, and achieve customer satisfaction.

I always believed that everything in life, including science consists of symbols that identify and rule the laws to govern them. Thus i managed to teach myself MS Office and basic electronics and computer maintenance at the age of 13 and through such definition i gained most of what i know today . 

I don""t believe in titles where a person defines the knowledge he or she claims to have in mind based on some un-passionate compulsory readings.

","Our vision is to inspire the world for a better education. We are on a social mission of guiding students to the educational path that best suits their interests and strength. ",,"Our licence and office costs are already covered by an incubation for 1 year that we have won during Startup Weekend Sharjah 2012 competition (2nd place). In addition, we are winners of the 4th place in Startup Weekend Dubai 2012 with a cash money of Dh10,000.

The $50,000 will be well spent on our pilot and expansion stages. Online/offline marketing, university/school visits, graphic designing, and social media are some of the considered spending schemes.

We are looking forward to continue our progress as we are all fully dedicated to our startup to make things happen.","When students are about to graduate from high school, many of them find themselves lost and confused. They have to make critical life-changing decisions, as they are conflicted with so many different choices of universities and majors. 

Not only that, they have to face pressure from their parents, friends, and communities when deciding what the best options for them are; and most of the time they don""t even have the slightest clue, which makes the experience even more distressing!

People at later stages in life face a similar dilemma when going into post graduate studies.

Universities also face issues when it comes to students applying to them. They find it difficult to recruit the right caliber of students to their programs. When students join, there is a high dropout rate among students not enrolled in the optimal field of choice. Also, the application process in most universities is paper-based and rigid, hence utilizing human, time, and capital resources in an ineffective and inefficient way.

We used the nature resources to help reducing the global warming, so we used the animals to produce energy because we have many animals according to our agricultural environment. We used the idea of the generator to transform the kinetic energy of the animals to electric energy. When I did my experiment it was difficult to success but we tried till it succeeded and we got electricity. We simply used the animal to move and turn gears.

The idea of the project is using a smart phone to detect the faces of the people through the camera that is supposed to be on the blindâ€™s chest.
The camera detects the face and recognizes the person and his state, through the data base of faces and nonverbal communication. It transmits it then to the blind person through a vocal message that mentions the name and the state of the person. The camera can detect as well food and drinks and other products and makes the blind able to distinguish the sort, the date of expiration and the components of food and drink, etc.

Once integrated, they undergo a rigorous monitoring process assessing ongoing key risks, country risk with monthly financial reports & annual due diligence report",,"Similar microfinance platforms are Kiva, Wokai and LendForpeace, but they are non-profit organizations and they allow lending to the micro-entrepreneurs directly through the MFI, solely focused in MENA on Palestine and some cases in Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq. MicroWorld.org, part of the PlaNet Finance Group, is a peer-to-peer platform that was launched 18 months ago in France. It has a similar model to Pi Slice, channeling funds from individual lenders and large companies to MFIs around the world, albeit so far with low penetration in MENA and so far only offering non-remunerated loans for individual lenders. Pi Slice and MicroWorld decided to bring together their experience and resources in the fields of technology, MFIs, and the MENA region to create a partnership that can bring a new form of social action to MENA.
Competitive advantage of Pi Slice: Pi Slice presents a new approach linking MENA MFIs in need of funding to investors wishing to provide finance to MFIs for social reasons. While understanding the concerns of such investors â€“such as transparency, accountability, sustainability, performance, risk, etc.-, along macro MENA drivers and the challenges of MFIs in MENA, Pi Slice achieves the following competitive advantages:
-	Pi Slice has the first-mover advantage;
-	Pi Slice operates in MENA, a market that is under-penetrated and under-funded for the Micro Finance industry that still lacks on regulations and transparency;
-	Pi Slice is an innovative business model supported by tier one strategic partners and a highly motivated and qualified team;
-	Pi Slice will be listing MFIs according to strict selection criteria ensuring transparency, investment and social performance, low risk, sustainability, outreach, etc. MFIs will have more accountability incentives to remain part of the Pi Slice network;
-	Pi Slice will ensure the money to be properly invested to MFIs that in turn lend to their customers, all this supported by the PlanetFinance group of companies;
-	Pi Slice will have its own technology system â€“ developed by MicroWorld.org - that allows users to easily navigate the site, and allows Pi Slice to monitor transactions, traffic, and control fraud;
-	Pi Slice will create a new sustainable and profitable CSR channel for corporations and institutions, and therefore new sources of funding for MFIs through CSR programs and individual investors.
","Driven by social impact, Pi Slice empowers micro-entrepreneurs, who are otherwise excluded from access to credit by formal banking institutions, to start and grow businesses, engage in income-generating activities, and thereby transform their own lives as well as those of others by becoming job creators rather than job seekers. By giving a small online loan, a lender can provide aspiring micro-entrepreneurs with a life-altering opportunity to overcome poverty, enter the formal economy, and proliferate available employment opportunities, thus accelerating development. This would not only enable microfinance institutions (MFIs) to build a sustainable future for the industry, but also help shape the regionâ€™s future economies, communities, and competitiveness.  
In the regionâ€™s development process, the individuals & private sector is now presented with an unparalleled CSR channel to unlock the abilities of millions of unemployed youths, activate human capital in the labor force, and solve economic crises, hence actively contribute to the sustainable development of the MENA region. Today, Pi Slice unveils its MENA portal for individual and corporate investors, opening doors to a brighter future.
",,"1.3 Million Dollars in Funding","Pi Slice will be in the business of assisting and advising Micro Finance Institutions on marketing micro finance schemes. It will operate a platform that allows individuals and businesses to finance projects of micro-entrepreneurs around the world by making loans. 
This advice may include generic advice, a statement, opinion or report. Other services would include:
-	Understanding the budgets and needs of prospective MFIs;
-	Advising MFIs on opportunities;
-	Assisting MFIs in identifying and selecting relevant prospective investors in the target region;
-	Assisting MFIs in organizing product road shows and marketing visits; and
-	Assisting MFIs in maintaining and enhancing their relationships with investors and prospective investors
Pi Slice will effectively be arranging credit for MFIs through approaching corporate investors as well as high net worth individuals. MFIs will remunerate Pi Slice for its services in return in accordance with any fee arrangement. The internet portal for corporate investors and high net worth individuals will include relevant financial and operating information on the MFIs, as well as detailed selection criteria, to facilitate the decisions of Lenders. Once the Lenders decide on which MFI they want to lend to, they can remit the funds directly to the chosen MFI who will then release the funds to their Customers. Loans will have a repayment period of 12 to 24 months. Once loans are repaid to the Lenders, they can decide whether they intend to relend. The interest that is earned by the MFIs on their onward lending to Customers varies depending on the country, and the Lenders will receive a return according to each MFI of their choice. 

",,,,,,,"Pi Slice will achieve its sales targets through a 2-pronged approach:  digital marketing and direct sales. 
Digital Marketing: Pi Slice will use a sophisticated digital marketing strategy which it has developed including social media (Facebook, Twitter), Google ads, PR & media presence, blog & microshows to reach as much as possible Arab internet users. Firstly, it will use SEO and online lead generation techniques to drive potential Lenders to its website. Secondly, it will launch an online marketing campaign on leading regional portals to attract traffic of potential Lenders. This will incorporate a social networking strategy on sites such as LinkedIn, Twitter, Branchout, Facebook targeting professionals, in addition to placing strategic ads on websites that are business & lifestyle orientated such as AME Info, Dubizzle, etc. Finally, it will send out targeted email campaigns to new and existing customers to increase its market share., Pi Slice has partnered up with Xische &Co. (one of its shareholders) to launch together an integrated digital media strategy.
Direct sales / Road show: The major market for Pi Slice will be corporate Lenders through their CSR programs. To attract corporations, Pi Slice will have a dedicated direct sales team to go and build close professional ties with leading companies. Through its business networks as well as attending CSR related events, Pi Slice will secure Lenders and corporate sponsorships.

It is also difficult for such institutions to provide transparency to the Lenders. Such institutions rely historically in MENA on donations, and donors are not always informed as to where the money is really going. Pi Slice acts as one-point-of-portal broker between Lenders and selected partner MFIs. The Pi Slice web based platform will provide detailed information to Lenders on selected partner MFIs, through their social and investment performance, risk, outreach, transparency, regulation, sustainability, etc. Pi Slice will also follow-up on a regular basis with the MFIs through relationships built with the MFI network.
The parties involved will follow these simple steps:
-	Step 1 â€“ Pi meets the Lender and then refers the Lender to the MFI; 
-	Step 2 â€“ Lender registers and creates an account: create an account by submitting an application  online or by downloading the forms in PDF format and submitting the completed forms to MFI; 
-	Step 3 â€“ Lender activates account: the activation instructions are sent to Lenderâ€™s email address once step 2 (registration) is complete; and
-	Step 4 â€“ Lender confirms identification: Upon activation, Lender will need to send in an ID Confirmation Form.
All the Lenders will follow these simple steps:	
-	Step 1 â€“ Lender views the micro finance projects via the web platform of Pi Slice;  
-	Step 2 â€“ Lender selects a project and gives the money to the MFI; 
-	Step 3 â€“ MFI passes the money to the Customer; and
-	Step 4 â€“ MFI pays the fee to Pi-Slice.
","Pi Slice is a social web based platform â€“ developed in partnership with MicroWorld from the  PlanetFinance Group - promoting social awareness and change. Its framework is a unique connecting system that links individuals and companies wishing to provide finance to MENA based MFIâ€™s, which in turn use the funds to provide micro-credit to their customers. Through this web based platform, motivated individuals and companies can help MFIâ€™s in the MENA region to build a sustainable future for micro-entrepreneurs & a favorable ecosystem for macro development. MicroWorld.org, part of the PlaNet Finance Group, is a peer-to-peer platform that launched 18 months ago in France.
