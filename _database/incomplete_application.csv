Organically grown foods mean that these organic foods have been grown on land that is absent of any chemicals for a minimum of 3 years. The crops are grown without the use of pesticides or any chemicals whatsoever. Organic foods are processed and packaged without the use of artificial preservatives, colorings, irradiation or any other additives.
we produce all kind of organic fresh fruits and vegetables.
"," There are numerous benefits to both eating organic foods, and to organic gardening. we personally believe that a huge benefit comes from a renewed relationship with nature. It starts with an ""I won""t poison you, you won""t poison me"" attitude, and ends with ""I""ll nurture and respect you, you nurture and respect me."" 

 Gardening is just plain good for the soul. 

so our target for all the people to be on the safe  side.
eating organic it means eating healthy food.","we will first target the british market then expend to all arab countries and lebanon.","we believe the total size of the market to exceed up to one million people, this represent one billion usd.
cause our business secret is based on the international exchange rates from us dollars to pounds,it means there is a huge benefits from the cost of production in lebanon for the fresh fruits and vegetables to be delivered to london.
we can explain it , like for an exemple 1$usd cost of production could be sale at 5 pound in the UK.
this make a huge difference between the cost of prodction and the sale prices.","in fact there is no competitor in our private line of production cause we produce a specific kind of organic fresh fruits and vegetables to be delivered on daily to heathrow airport in london by the british airways and MEA.
after our study of the lebanese market and  companies , we found that there is no competitor befor we start our line of production who is working on export organic to the UK.from beirut to london.

that is an advantage for us to build the first one billion of usd in easy way.
this is not just a number we can prove it.","The pros in ""going organic"" is that organic food is free from artificial chemicals, pesticides, antibiotics, growth-promoters and fertilizers. It is produced using environmentally friendly methods and is free from genetically modified ingredients .
       Organic foods according to some studies show that they have more vitamins and beneficial trace elements than conventionally grown food and so may be more nutritious .","about $200 000 usd dollars","about $75000 usd dollars","none because we knows our target and markets like tesco and mark&spencer",none,"Organic foods are not mass-produced and traditional organic farming often produces lower yields than modern intensive farming methods. That is why organic food is generally more expensive than non-organic.
 Who knows what will be considered healthy eating in the future At this point, organic foods seem to be beneficial. 
that""s why we have 60 month of lead minimum
","with our high overhead , we believe that the company will break even after 4 to 5 months.","4 to 5 months","there is no risks in producing , the only one is on delivering by the british airways if there is delay for the shippment but we can solve it  by the insurance to cover all risk.","we need to explain two important thing to you;

1-to produce the fresh fruits and vegetables in lebanon it means at the lower price cause the cost of rent and salaries and all kind of expences is lawer than england.

2- even after the cost of production is law , but the cost of sale is very high.
in some items it cost in lebanon $2 usd dollars but it sale in $37 usd dollars in london.

so, we can prove it in the international market the difference of prices , that""s why we can cover all our investment and all kind of expences from the beginnig and from the first 4 months cause the production is every 3 months.","probably 10% or better",NULL,"we believe that we can penetrate 25% of the market in 5 years.","1 billion usd dollars",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Furthermore, a website with an online store will be created in order to host my products and a complete online marketing strategy will ensure visibility and increase sales. In the future the company will develop Arabic video games in house and contribute in creating local job opportunities. ","My target audience will be local and regional Arabs from different age group that have access to the internet and would be interested in my products. 49% of the online users in MENA region are under twenty five years of age.
33% of the online users in the MENA region are between 26 and 35 years of age.
The rest of the online users (18%) in the MENA region are over 35 years of age.
It is important to note that the purchasing power is divided between these three groups. We will have a variety in our products that would appeal to large chunk of MENA online users.
","Since the nature of our product will appeal to Arabs, the major geographical target market would be the MENA region. Nevertheless, expatriates all over the globe could purchase our products through an easy 3 step online checkout system. In the beginning it is important to target the GCC countries because they have the largest percentage of purchasing power between all the regional countries. ","according to the internet world stats and the MADAR research, 34 million internet users in the Middle East, 17.5 million users in the GCC-Levant region, with 920% growth from year 2000 to 2007. the size of the market would be at a minimum of 34 million dollars. 
","My competitors in the Middle East would be established video game resellers, video game developers and international distributors. Already a social network base online video game called trivian.ae is being marketed extensively all over the net and is ranking extremely high in terms of visibility and online user registration. As long as the internet penetration is growing in the MENA region, I would expect a equal growth of competitors in the next 5 years.","My product would consist of popular video games that are being dubbed into an Arabic and this alone is a new concept that would be Attractive to my target audience. Furthermore, in order to appeal to a larger audience, i will get popular Arab sports anchors and celebrities to dub the scripts and characters. My products would bring a customized video gaming experience that is totally adapted to an Arab audience. My products would be supported by online forums where people can join and connect, all in Arabic. My products will be high in quality at affordable prices. My products would be accessible to all age groups and purchased at all major retail stores and/or online. ",20000$,150000$,100000$,,"As long as i am the first to acquire the licenses of top selling and popular video games and guarantee a distribution exclusivity, I would be ahead of any competition at least for the first 36 months. Soon enough, the company will start by developing video games in house both for consoles and the internet and take the advantage over any competitor that tries to catch on.","I would estimate that the company would break even after 24 months. The budget for the first year would be mainly spent on acquiring the video game licenses, setting up the studio, developing the website and finalizing the product. The second year""s budget would be spent mainly on marketing, distribution creating a sales force and continuing to acquire licenses.   ","I would estimate that the first sale would be made 8-10 months after i start.","The lack of experience is the major risk that is running against me. I plan to be surrounded by experienced advisers and consult some risk management firms. The online purchasing behavior is still not very popular in the Middle East and if the rate does not grow exponentially in the near future it would affect my marketing strategy, therefore, online advertising should not be the soul, instead should be included in the global marketing strategy of the company.  ",,"Regional online spend registered YOY growth of 19.4% in 2007 to $34.6 million in 2008. 16% growth  per year",10000$,"i would hope to capture 25% of that market in the first 5 years.","if i reach 25% of the market and the product was sold for 10$ i would generate 87.5 million dollars in the first 5 years",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Mission and Philosophy well detailed along with CV of founder Dr. Robert Kaldawi (Ph. D).
In summary, we will be establishing a branch of Academy of Health education in Lebanon to educate, treat, rehabilitate addictions, includes but not limited to alcohol / drugs / compulsive disorders such as food and gambling addictions. Further, to treat and educate community on aspects of stress management, meditation, anxiety and depression. The aim is to change attitudes towards a more positive approach to life, a better perception, to move, touch and inspire and create a transformation for the better throughout the middle east.","The general community as a whole, particularly, those suffering from afflictions relating but not limited to alcohol, drug, food, gambling or other addictions. Diabetes awareness, nutritional education and treatment, depression and anxiety, stress management, meditation. This includes people as young as 16 to the older or much older community. Furthermore, there is a push in the Orient and the middle east towards junk food, fast food, recreational drug use, hard party drugs. The purpose of this mission is to target the communities most vulnerable, such as those from vulnerable educational, social or economical backgrounds and also those with genetic predisposition to such afflictions.","Entire of Lebanon at the start and then, proceed to cover the Middle East and the Arab World as required and necessary.","Whilst there is no provision for commercial gains at this stage, the purpose is to help people and later to spread the word of health and positiveness. This in turn will be followed by power of word of mouth and benefit of health and liufestyle improvement across the entire community. Those in need will be treated free of charge, those who can afford it, will pay a fee per consultation. The estimate income is around half a million USD per year.","None.
However, there may be some current medical treatment available for those affected by such ailments described above. Nevertheless, such available treatment philosophy and approach is different in nature and characteristics to the one planned by this organisation. Therefore, our methods are new and unique. Accordingly, there no competition in absolute terms to our proposal.","The advantages will be self evident and measured by rates of success.
The philosophy will be based on a modern approach to addictions, harm minimisation, genetic awareness and assessment and prevention, treatment and rehabilitation.
Thus, the advantages will be second to none as the approach is second to none.
The motivation is also unique and provides our approach with a tremendous advantage and a cut above the rest, namely the approach to inspire people to change and follow a path of awareness, positive and healthy lifestyle management including both inner and outer health ","Infrastructure Costs / Office / Staff / Equipments / telephone etc... approximately 150.000 USD","Salaries consultants / electronic and written media educational campaigns /approximately 200.000 USD","$50.000 USD for marketing expenses.","Testing equipments / breathalysers / Drug testing / Glucose monitoring / Psychological testing tools $50.000 USD","At least few years. The exposure and unique characteristics of our team members, their noble motivation and their fluency in arabic as well as exposure to the latest technical and professional training and qualifications in the world cannot be easily matched by other teams with similar talents on offer.","We should break even in the 1st year of operation.","As most consultancies will be based on donations rather than a set price, we imagine that, in return to our proven methods of success it should not take more than 6 months to be efficient in our sales and 3 years to return our expenditure.","There are no real risks as this is a wholistic approach to health and wellbeing proven to work.
The only risk amounts to refusal of the lebanese community to accept our approach or philosophy based on principle. This is very hard to see particularly as there is no initial commercial motive to our approach and our aim is to improve health and lifestyle. Accordingly, we are going to create a positive difference in the community which will be sensed contagiously and succeed synergistically.","Please help us provide a wave of positive change in attitudes and perceptions beginning with Lebanon and reaching the entire Middle east and Arabic Worlds.

This community based learning approach allows anyone to play the role of both educator and learner. We will provide the technology to connect learners and educators and facilitate remote learning.","Our target clients will be primarily high school and university aged people(16-30)  who are computer literate, own a PC, and have access to an internet connection.We expect to appeal mainly to people who are typically familiar with social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter.","Our target market will be major urban areas with high schools and universities. We will target mainly gulf countries where the level of internet usage is the highest, especially amongst high-school and university aged students, and where the average disposable income amongst this age group is the highest.","We estimate the advertisement market on websites to be around $5,000,000 in 2009 from direct advertisements or through 3rd parties.

Additionally we we will be competing with local schools and universities which offer tutoring, extracurricular programs, and workshops.
","We offer our clients the ability to choose educators based on a variety of factors such as geographical proximity, client ratings and reviews, language of instruction, time of course offerings, and methods of instruction (audio, video, in person). Unlike our competitors, this effectively allows our clients to tailor a course to their personal needs. Additionally since we are a social networking site, we will scale better. This means as the user base grows, so do the number of educators, and the variety and number of courses offered. Additionally, a growing user base also allows for healthy competition between educators competing for students, and this effectively should drive our prices lower than our competitors over the long run.",,,,,"13- How long (in months) do you believe you can maintain your advantage over the competition until they match your product / service?

For instance, this would allow doctors to discover and trace side effects of a particular medication within a given community. ","- Physicians practicing in private clinics
- Public clinics
- Dispensaries
- Medical Centers
- Laboratories (In a later project phase)*
 
It is worthy to note that such applications are available in the market, for Hospitals only; however, for private clinics use, our preliminary study showed that no such application is implemented in Lebanon yet.
 
*: In a later phase, an application for laboratories will be developed to link the patients files with their laboratory tests. This application depends on the centralized database feature discussed in question 12.","Starting in Lebanon, and potentially expanding to the region (Arab World).","According to the Lebanese Order of Physicians, we have 9,516 currently practicing physicians.
In the launching phase (the first 2 years), we plan on selling our product for a $1,000 initial fee, plus an additional $200 yearly maintenance/support fee. In the initial phase (i.e. Lebanon only):
9,516 * 1,000 = $9,516,000","- We do not have direct competitors in Lebanon, as companies which develop similar applications target bigger institutions (i.e. Hospitals)
- It is expected that some of the above companies start developing a smaller scale version of their application
- Other Software Engineering companies might develop a similar application","The advantages that make our product suitable and competitive in its target market are:
- It provides statistical information, useful for medical research and for the development of the health industry
- It is localized (i.e. available in Arabic)
- It is affordable
- Data management becomes easier in digital format
- The application has multiple interfaces with different privileges (i.e. head of unit, doctor, secretary...)
- It has a calendar feature with the option of sending automated sms messages to both patients and doctors
- It saves office space by ridding doctors from paper documents
- It is environmentally friendly :)

In Phase 2:
- It collects ""anonymized"" patients data from participating physicians, and gathers them in a centralized database in order to generate more representative statistics
- The centralized database allows us to link the doctors application with the laboratories in order to improve the medical care QOS","$9,500 = 4,500 (computers) + 5,000 (furniture)","$39,150 = 1,200*3*9 (salaries) + 600*9 (rent) + 150*9 (office supplies) ","$10,000","$0,000","As long as EPM is the primary focus of the company, we will be able to maintain our competitive edge.","Assuming that yearly sales are 100 programs (1% of the market), then the dollar value of these sales after x months of the 1st sale is 100 * (x / 12) * $800.

The company will design, integrate and maintain the hardware and software necessary for this link between the business and the consumer.","Target clients focus includes frequent shoppers searching for new products from associated businesses, and individuals with need for a frequent certain product setting, to be quickly realized, maybe automatically, by the associated business. An example for the fist case would be shopping for garments, while for the second case would be buying the usual coffee configuration.
There are no certain age groups or segment of clients initially targeted. The aim is to develop the technology behind the end product and to search for main associates that would drive the application of this technology in different retail segments.","The first associates should be corporate retailers that span on several branches in several cities. This is followed by local retailers in large cities that join with benefits and as the technology proves itself. Focus will be on malls in big cities, with new malls founded rapidly containing several chain businesses.","It is hard to estimate the success of a breakthrough technology. An estimate would be anywhere between 100k USD to 1 million USD, depending on successful business associations.","The technology will compete with online retail, which is practically another approach, usually feared as insecure and not localized within the region.
There are several customer loyalty cards that are occasionally offered for free at stores and subscription cards that allow for discounts at several stores per card. These methods have proven not to be successful and are not interactive, not allowing the experience for the buyer and the customer link with the reseller.","The planned merit found by the end-consumer is the ability to link previous shopping experiences with current ones, and through development of the merchant""s database, be provided with personalized products that can make the shopping experience easier and faster. The merit for the associated businesses is to recieve a ready infrastructure to build databases based on client behaviour, allowing for better product delivery through decreasing human error and facilitating purchase survey. Our final product will retail at a low cost for the consumer, while businesses join the network through lending of hardware and customizable IT infrastructures. This is attainable through utalizing outsourced hardware specifically configured, with low costs, for this concept.","40,000$ for the product development.","40,000$ for the office, salaries, and contracting.","80,000$ to mass advertise the technology .","40,000$ for the store devices.","At least 24 months. With the correct expansion plans and making and seizing opportunity, it is likely that none will be able to compete with the well established technology and solid cooperations.","12 to 18 months. The income will rely on business contracting for the hardware and the software, and data entry and maintaining fares, along with the end-consumer fare for the service.","6 months.","Consumer and business disapproval of a new technology or not seeing the benefit in this automation technology. This concept relies and participates in the large and expanding retailing industry in the region. Adding a new factor in this multi-billion USD industry will allow retailers to compete on a new level.","The scalability of this technology has no limits in the breadth of applications. Software can be develpoed to accompany this consumer service to monitor one""s dietary consumption, for example, and link it to a restaurant database for foods"" nutrition values.","Starting with rapid expansion, then an estimated 10% to 20%.",None.,"There is no current market for this particular service.","Again, this depends on the acceptance of the service.

I""m a member od network marketing company ""QuestNet"". It is hongkong based company started at 1998. It is also registered under case trust(Consumer Association of Singapore). Its absolutely legal in Singapore and in India Finance minister""s wife(Nalini Sidambaram) is legal advisor to the company. You can also view online who is joining under your tree.
All you have to do is invest US$540 and you refer 2 people below you. Those people will invest US$540 and refer 2 people below them. Each person can refer only 2 people. Like wise the tree will grow on. Whenever you get 3 referrals below you on each side you get US$250. This network will grow on. The only thing you have to do is refer as many people as possible. For the Investment you make you will get some product.
You have to be 18 years + to join. You invest only small amount of money and earn more. I know people who earn US$5000 per month. You can join only if anyone refers you. You can check other members who join under you through online. If you want anyone to join under you, you can make them join seeing your tree level. So you can make the network grow if you see that anyone has stopped making referrals under you.

This estimation is due to hiring programmers, IT staff members,Public Relations, sales people, Marketing and Advertsing,  we might outsource the Accounting and Finance people.","We are considered to be market new entrants, and since our idea is new not only to the local market, but also to the global market we will be the fist comers and will be having only small competitors which is every company that is to offer automated services.

We are planning to open offices and retails in all the GCC countries.","The ICONIC concept consists of nurturing the creativity of our young Arab designers and opens for them the doors to realize their dreams and be able to show to the world that we have talented Arab designers and we will create the new trends of tomorrow in a very fashionable way thus conveying and transferring to all the world our culture and our potential in a very beautiful and peaceful way thus we are going to enable those designers in a very intelligent and efficient way to face to the competition of the huge fast fashion mass products that doesnâ€™t take into consideration the preferences nor the cultural fingerprint of the people in each countries. Today all the Arab designers will have the opportunity to create a piece of art a fashion item ( such as cloth or an accessories in one or more categories: handbags, accessories, wardrobe, Ready-to-wear, Jewels),then all those designs will be posted on the ICONIC website which will be marketed through creating a viral marketing campaign thus saving money that will be invested more efficiently in other area, where the customers will enter the website and vote to the best designers and rank the products. The top products that receive the highest score will be manufactured and sold at the ICONIC  website and unique stores where the customers will find the most exclusive and fashionable products that meets best theirs tastes in a great environment where they will have the chance to meet the designers of their cloths in the shop where there will be an open space where some designers will always be present and working (designing, drawing, cuttingâ€¦)thus the customers will see the world of the designers. In addition to we should mention that we are using the internet voting in order to be able to collect information of our customers thus targeting them better, and we should not forget the amount of Publicity we will receive as well the word of mouth marketing that will be created through this competition where each designer will tell his friend about the conceptâ€¦","As a beginning our stores will target women that are between the age of 18 and 35 years that have an acceptable purchasing power and are willing to pay on average 35% higher than they would pay for at the usual fast fashion shops such as Vero Moda or H&M. Our target market at this age will be probably working and having additional income and usually is ready to spent larger amount of money for shopping, moreover during this age women are open to change and are ready to try something new , they need to looks unique and up-to-date not only wearing like everyone the low quality products that today are almost the same in all the stores , those products that doesn""t take in consideration a lot the taste diffrence between Occident. and the Arab countries.We choose to position ourselves in the mind of the customer as delivering better Quality as well Unique and Fashionable clothes that will fit the best its taste at every moment and occasions. ","My ICONIC concept was born when we were able to see a Real need and an underserved market which is very large thus we would be operating at a very efficient way in the short and long term.

After sensing this need we used more scientific approach to be able to make sure that what we saw is real and there is a real opportunity, thatâ€™s why we did for long time research studies and used proper marketing research tools such as survey (more than 311 people filled our survey, we did interviews with 87 people to be able to know and understand their purchasing behavior and what they believe is missed in this industry and asked them what we could to fulfill their needs and improve the way they shop, and used some observational research to validate our previous results).","based on our estimation of the size of the market: 
200,000 women including tourists , spent around 250$ per year on average at the products in similar category . the size of the market in dollar term will be around:50,000,000$

(this is the estimation based on the market than we reach from our first stores and internet sales. It is very important to note that the market is larger especially if we will expand to the arab countries as we plan to do .)","We expect that in year 3 we will be established and having an efficient production and marketing unit, and by then we would be able to solve all our logistics problem that we faced in the first two year such as delivering the right item at the right time for all the GCC countries and by then we would be able to solve all the pending legal issues that normally arise when exporting to new countries and by then as well will have an efficient distribution system by working with sub agent, as well we would be able to sell for all the GCC countries through our website and POS,our sales at Year 3 will be around 1,200,000$ those sales are generated on average by 12,000 persons that spent on average 100$ each year. Those figures are conservative and based on our marketing research which could be higher or lower depending on different factors which we will be more than happy to discuss it with you upon your request. Please not that our sales will raise exponentially with around 100% when we enter U.A.E. at year 3. The profit margin is high in this industry we expect to have aprofit margin of 18% which 216,000$. which will be around 500,000 after 1,2 year we enter U.A.E. and around another 100 % (of the 500,000$) after 1,2 year we enter K.S.A. so in year 6 we will have profit of 1,000,000 $ taking into consideration our starting financial resources, however by year 5 we would have this high production capacity.","The Start-up cost are the cost of the website which is 5,000 and the marketing cost 10,000(which is low since we are concentration on Publicity) the other 35,000 will be invested in production and inventory cost which at first will be handeled by a third party in order to avoid high investing cost in production. We need 25,000 to pay for the decoration of our retail and we need another 15,000 as working capitalto pay for employee and other expense till we strt generating cash flow and profit. The rent will be paid at the end of the first year which will be paid from our profit.

Total Fund needed is around 90,000$
","A very important things in this project is the cost structure that decrease significalty the risk take. Since we are going to cooperate with manufacturer to manufacture our products at the beging we wonâ€™t have to invest a lot of money. Our Fixed cost will be around 98,500$which includes : Retail rent,legal costs,decoration, equipement , accessories to disply the merchandise.As well the website development.","The main competitors are the fast fashion companies such as Zara and H&M which sell mass products which are affordable however we are planning to deliver better quality products at a reasonable price and to sell the customer products that fits well his taste as well sell them an experience thus letting them appreciate the high value they are receiving. We want to position ourselves as providing good quality products that are fashionable and affordable at the same time which they wonâ€™t find elsewhere that fits their tastes.","The marketing expenses will be low since we are going to focus to create a buzz marketing . As well we want to create trend to this new concpet a certain style life and thus we will be able to do that through the tools that will reach our target the best as well that are not very costly, such as Facebook and twitter, Fashion Magazine, Radio, Website and advertisement, competition and events ( such as a small fashion show). we estimate our marketing expense to be around 155,500$","90,000 $ (sales values: 395,000$) on average we will try to keep as much as possible low by having just-in time invetory and to be able to be flexible by repsonding to any changes in tastes of the market.","Since we will be the first to manage all those talents and to join them in one place by creating this first time concept and experience this will make us to win a big loyalty from our customers and to defend very well our positions in the market because we will be the refrence of this concept. We will build high brand loyalty as well we will maitain a good relation with all our designers .Moreover we will try to have contract with the best designer for several years as well we will give those designer what they deserve and this will attract all the good designers to work with us. In addition to that we will have in place all the logisitcs. All those factors will make it difficult for new entrants for at least the couple years to comes. Once any new entrants will try to enter the market he will be perceived as copying our concepts.","Briefly I can say that we are providing good quality products that are fashionable and affordable at the same time which they wonâ€™t find elsewhere and it fits their tastes. In addition to that they live an amazing experience while buying the products and will have an emotional attachment to the product which they know the designer of it.","Briefly I can say that we are providing good quality products that are fashionable and affordable at the same time which they wonâ€™t find elsewhere and it fits their tastes.

In addition to that we are taking into consideration the cost to enter the new market and the difficulties to enter them. So we will start by Lebanon , and then U.A.E. which is a very interesting market and easy to penetrate after that we are planning to go to K.S.A ; After year 3 we expect to have a high sales level . After those countries we will go to smaller countries such as Quarter, Oman, Yemen â€¦","Please note that I had a technical difficulties updating the information on the management team . I am not sure if it is update properly. I will be grateful if you can let me know what are the information appearing at your screen. Since this project was prepared since last year and till this year we are proposing it and during all this period we were working on it.

My ICONIC concept was born when we were able to see a Real need and an underserved market which is very large thus we would be operating at a very efficient way in the short and long term.

Due to the technical Problem the system is not taking my information I am going to fill it here: 

Name : Mounir Sfeir

BBA from the American Univeristy of Beirut

Currently working at L""OREAL M.E.A. Dubai as Assistant Product Manager.

Previous internships: Auditing- Deloitte and Touch ; Finance: Financial House Elite ; Marketing","Size of our target market is quite high. we have prepared a full study containing picture which will illustrate our study. At this stage I would like to tell you that our sales and growth for the first 3 and 5 years were based on the market size as well on our production capacity.","The business model will be selling items that are designed by our Arab designers and gives them a Royalty fee of 7-11% of the sales Price. In addition to that we will hold different event which will be a source of money for us in addition to selling the products but the main cash flow will be from the sales on our website and retails.",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,"- I am not proposing a products or simple service however I am creating a new concept that will change our lifestyle and will give a great opportunity for us to reveal our true preferences and taste which will give us a sort of pride and satisfaction moreover we are providing the chance for people to go beyond their potential and develop and nurture their skills. Itâ€™s time to be active and not only passive as an Arab world which most of the time is a follower for other countries or culture or taste when it comes to fashion and sometimes has to adapt certain trends that doesnâ€™t necessarily fits his true needs . Moreover the way we are creating and selling the products will be an astonishing experience for the final customers that will live, feel, taste and choose the products through all the phases. He will decide which products will be created and which ones wonâ€™t be created, so from the first moment there will be a certain emotional relation that will be created with the designer and products. Moreover we will use internet technology such as database technology which we will analyze carefully in order to be able to reach our customers and be able to provide them the proper product. Above all, the experience that the customers will live while purchasing their products and the chance to meet the designer of his cloths will be something that he/she would love to live it again over and over again.","The time to create the website and to launch it and start the concept takes around 3.5 months, the competition will end in 2 month , the production will takes around 1.5 months. (of course other activities will be taking place at the same time such as decorating the reail...) So it will take us around 7 months",2

Weâ€™d like to provide our potential customers with a high quality ice cream, soft & hot drinks, and snacks. In addition, we are to offer them a variety of choices. In other words, we are to offer a thick width of product lines. ","middle and high income customers, males and femals, from a wide age range (5-75) in remote locations far from restaurants and cafÃ©s.","My target market is customers located in remote areas such as: beach resorts, sport and music events, open air festivals, gardens, schools, companies, downtowns, and so on. ","according to Total Available Market Analysis (TAM),  we are  expecting, if operating only in beaches, and by considering geographical, lifestyle, and demographic factors a market of approximately 150 million dollars if having enough vans operating in all the moroccan beaches during summer times. We are not to cover all the market at the beginning, however.","There are no potential competitors in the Moroccan market operating in the same sector we are going to work in. Our system of managing, selling, and operating is very distinctive since we are going to rely on good service and smart marketing strategy. There is a wide unexploited market in Morocco that can be considered for further market development (deploying more units around Morocco).Dense areas would provide certain monopoly and relatively high rate of sales 

","The first operating mobile company in its type that would offer solutions to customers in remote areas would, as cited before, monopolize the market since scarcity of competitors.
Our company has the know how to operate efficiently in such market since my father has more than 40 years experience in making ice cream, food and drinks in his restaurant. Our product would respects the standards of quality and hygiene.
",2000,3000,5000,None,"It is difficult, since kept a secret by my father, to figure out the way commercial ice cream and drinks are made. The equipment that would be used, eventually imported from the U.S., would not be easily accessible to all future competitors. If operating adequately, future competitors would realize that it is not easy to enter the market because we will work hard on the perceived value related to the brand.","I am expecting to get off the break even period, that is to earn profit, after one month of sales if starting in summer.","Immediately if administrative tasks (hygiene certificate, permit) and overhead are totally available, which is less than one month, in theory.","The small space of the truck can impose some challenges as to further product development. Our activity can be seasonal (6 to 9 months of operation per year). The truck and fridges coffee machine need much energy to operate the whole day (gas expenses). Ice cream consumption is relatively weak in Morocco, especially in cold seasons.","For weaknesses and threats, our company would proceed in minimizing their negative impacts on our business. For energy, our company would use photovoltaic solar system on the truck to provide energy mainly for lighting. As to weak seasons, Ice cream Inc. would try to operate in hot areas (southern provinces, Agadir) and occasionally on sunny days. Our company would proceed in establishing a good customer relationship so that retain loyalty to our brand.  
		
","dependeing on the number of tourists and visitors, it would be 5%.","70.000 (imported and equiped Ford E series (or similar) Catering truck and several carts)","since there is no actual competition in Morocco, I am expecting to control more that 90% market share.","We are expecting more that 500.000 dollars according the resources we will begin with.",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Actully, it is a home that contains all the sections of a normal house ( Kitchen, Living Room, Salon, Garage, Roof, Gardens ..). My idea is to specialize every section in what costumers demand. For example, Kitchen will be composed of several restaurants( chinese, italian, Arabian, American..) and so on..","Actually, let me say that this house will be a place where everyone can find what they aiming for. Further, a house that contains restaurants (Kitchen), swiming pools (Roofs), CafÃ© (Gardens), Night Clubs(Garages), Entertaiment Room ( Young""s room), PLay Yards ( Back section of the house), could not have specific costumers. So, once that house is launched, it will attract all the market""s clients, spectially that there""s no direct competitors.","As i mentioned, the house will take place in Lebanon, that country that is the target of a lot of tourists in the region and out of it. So, in addition to Lebanese citizens, we will have a lot of foreign persons that will be attracted by the place and the idea.","It depends on company""s management. Anyway as a Business Administration Student I can tell that the size will be between 2 million and 4 million for the first 2 years than it will go to increase and specially in summer seasons.","This is my idea, there""s no direct competitor, you can find a lot of restaurants, night clubs, private swmining pools, cafees. But there""s only one place that you can find all this issues together, ""FEEL HOME"".","Advantages are severals. Maybe having everything they seek for 24 hours per day is one of the most important advantage.","1,000,000 $","240,000$","120,000$","450,000$","As i Told you before, just they idea of being in a place that contains what every person seeks for makes me mainting the advantage.","6 to 8 months.","Whenever the house is launched, sales will starts. ( Not more than 4 to 6 months ).","There""s only one major risk that faces me: The stability of the economical-political situation, which after forming the new government, is mostly gone. And as we all know, because of the Lebanese Central Bank""s policies, there""s no more economical fear.","Actually, I know that such a project might not take the chance to go into the competition, because of the huge amounts and costs. I just want to get a feedback about my life project, from you as great professionals and business professors.

The project has two purposes: 
1-	Profitable 
2-	Social: everyone noticed that sport (especially football) has played major role in declining the violence in Baghdad and other provinces and in uniting the people during the sectarian violence after their national team in 2007; I believe that pushing young people forward sport will keep them away from other violence ideas; I believe that building a football court will help closing police station, I believe building a football court will help closing a hospital. 

","Basically, young amateur teams. but there are many men in the ages (30-50) who are willing to play football but there are no place to play. indoor courts with their small areas will help them practice their hobby.
 ","At the beginning, we will establish courts in Baghdad inside the districts  and when idea succeeds we will move to other province like Basrah, Najaf, Karbala, Babil and others. 
  ",,,"The idea is to build indoor football court, 6*6 players max, with some seats, around 100 seats; the company then will be the sponsor of these courts. The profits come from renting these courts to the armature teams to play. There are no enough courts in Baghdad, they are owned by the government, in bad conditions and has no business background.           
Our courts will be modern, equipped and maintained.

We plan to build 10 houses on stilts, these houses can accommodate from 2 to 6 people with every comfort known to every house (bedrooms, kitchenette, bathrooms, toilets, laundry, balcony, central heating...).
The project will be fully equipped with environmental facilities (Treatment Plant Wastewater, solar panels, gas water heater and only the steam room will be heated with wood).
For restoration, we expect that building a hostel for cooking day dishes is the most user friendly way of participatory spirit, collecting and cooking own farm fruits and vegetables.
In addition to the guest house, a large lounge & dining room, a large patio where people can relax, meet, exchange or enjoy a mint tea.","Every kind of people, but asthmatic people should be our first target because the climate in Benslimane is very beneficial for them.
All people who have respiratory failure, disease or illness we find a haven of peace and health in our land.
The second target is people who suffer from obesity, homeland will teach them how to manage them selves, relearn how to live, relearn how to eat and the most important thing is learn how to do physical exercises (Dina Alami is also certified as an NLP coach)
We will establish activities such as rides horse, racetrack on foot, mountain bike trail, archery, not forgetting a little gardening and impromptu picnics all around the land.
Our cottage will have a dormitory for backpackers; our third targeted clients; many clubs are very active in the last years and they visit Benslimane as a nice area for picnic and rest.","Europe: because Europeans likes Morocco, they look for ecotourism and the supply does not match the demand.
United States & Canada: the North American are unfamiliar with Morocco, most of them think that Morocco is a Asian country
Middle East: because they know normal and luxury tourism but never gone beyond it, I am proposing a real new tourism based on nature and environment.","Morocco welcomes every year 7.5 million of tourists. With a total turnover of more than 8 million dollars.
Morocco attracts almost 15 million overnight stays in classified establishments, so our market is located around 2 or 3% of total occupancy in Morocco. In dollar terms, that means 160.000 dollars.","High Atlas: 6 houses and breakfast (2 Ait Bougmez Valley,1 Anergui Valley, 1 Toubkal National Park, 1 Geographic MGoun Park, & the last near a mountain river in front of Dades Valley)
Middle Atlas: 2 bed and breakfast in Aguelmane Sidi Ali Lake & Ifrane
The Rif mountain range: only one in Talassemtane National Park
All of these houses and properties are basic with traditional materials, simple but comfortable.

","Healthy air, fresh food, local products, not even one motor in the farm. Ecotourism has a certain and prosper future.
All cooking will be in wood oven, bread will be prepared everyday with natural products from the farm.
What I am planning to have, is a real eco-tourist land with no car, no motor, no petrol.",100000,75000,12000,30000,"Not all the investors are attracted by the ecotourism, it""s been too long that this type of tourism exists, but in Morocco there are few people who believed it""s a good idea.
In Benslimane, no one invested in this type of tourism and I will be pleased to offer this type of service for the hundreds of people who are waiting for this initiative","Break-even will be reached after 6 years of operation if 10 houses are launched in the beginning of the business. But if the decision to build only 5 houses for the starting launch, we can attend our break even in only 2 years, because the cost of the houses is and the various expenses would be cut to reach less than half the investments.","With good communication and marketing, also alliances with travel agencies in different countries targeted, early nights could be recorded from the first season after opening.","The major risks that can work against my projects are the economic fluctuations, if so; people can not plan holidays in my farm.
There is also the Benslimane Airport project; it has to be achieved and direct flights should be programmed from at least two cities in each continent.
In the other hand, two positive points are helping my business plan; the roads are being completed, we are moving from a situation of a two-way road to a twice double road; also national and secondary roads are in the Plan Planning.
All the ingredients are held to improve the city of Benslimane and the major risks are to stop these investments.","It is high time for me to be independent, to achieve my aim in life. My family needs me; my children need to have a worthy and accomplished father. Until now I did not had extraordinary things, except working hard and coming back home with money which I had never seen the colour.","20 to 30%",10000,"4 to 8%","168.000 to 170.000 USD",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

The business aims to promote eco-tourism in Lebanon, since it is at its early stages in the region. PILOT ECO-HOLIDAYS can be a pioneer in entering this segment in Lebanon, developing it, and expanding it into other countries in the region, knowing that it is a very profitable business over the long term.","The main targeted segment for this hotel is the tourists, which are named â€œthe alternative touristsâ€. They are the tourists, who can be characterized by: trying to avoid the beaten track; going places nobody has set foot in before, bringing a senses of adventure, seeking to forget civilization for a while, establishing contacts with local people, tend to remain in the country for more days than more traditional tourists.In addition, there is another main target for this project which is the Lebanese diaspora around the world. It is estimated that the Lebanese diaspora is over 12 million persons. If the hotel can attract 2% of this diaspora, I think it will be enough to expand this project into other regions in Lebanon, and into other countries in the region.","There is no specific Geographic target market since our hotel aims at attracting guests from all over the world. therefore, our planning, and execution will be done while taking into consideration that we will receive guests from all over the world seeking to have the experience of a natural retreat, and to get the knowledge of green hospitality and its benefits.","taking into consideration that european individuals spend an average of 5000$ on their holidays, The increase of domestic tourism in lebanon, and the new plans of the ministry of tourism to attract tourists from all over the world, we would estimate the size of the market as 2 Billion Dollars/year market.","Our direct competitors in the market are all the environmental-friendly establishments which has the objective of promoting environmental activities, and awareness. These competitors have our same target marke. examples of these competitors are:
PEAKS Hotel/Faytroun, Le Refuge/Afqa. 
On the other hand, we have indirect competitors which are all types of resorts and hotels on the coastline which may attract any type of tourists. examples of this type of competitors are: Las Salinas/Anfeh, San Stephano Resort/Batroun, Edde Resort/Jbeil.
However, PILOT HOTEL have a lot of competitive advantages in order to overcome these obstacles.","The hotel will be a 150-room hotel with the opportunity to have outdoor camps in the wild. The construction of the hotel will be based on natural products, such as wood, fabrics, and there is no use whatsoever of cement, and concrete.
The Basic Hotel activities consist of the following: Climbing, Hiking, Cycling, Horseback riding, Archery, Rope course, Orienteering, Bird-watching.Since we are working on an eco-tourism project, than all the eco-tourism features, and aspects have to be taken into consideration. These aspects include:
1.Radically increase the productivity of resource
2.Shift to biologically inspired production 
3. Invest in natural and human capital. 
4. Select responsible suppliers.  
5. Product service system","5,000,000 USD","3,000,000 USD","500,000 USD","1,000,000 USD","The project consists of three main phases. The first phase is that during the first 30 month, the first property shall be opened in Batroun. The second phase consists of that within 2.5 years of operation other 4 properties shall be opened in other regions of Lebanon, and some of them are in sea zones cities. Therefore, we believe that we can maintain our advantage for a period of 5 years over the competition.","In our opinion, the first year will be a testing year in the market since the product we are offering is new, and the market is still young. However, taking into consideration the awareness over Environmental Friendly activities, and the potential annual 15% growth of the market, we would estimate that it would require 18 months before the company breaks even. ","The suggested time to finish the first phase of the project is 30 months. It consists of 18 months of construction, 6 months staffing, and 6 months for pilot opening.","These can be summarized as fears over:
-	Political and security instability;
-	The nature  of eco-tourism itself;
-	The lack of knowledge concerning the practical implementation of eco-tourism;
-	The over-polarisation of debate between mass and eco-tourism; and,
-	The possible inclination to turn small-scale into large-scale operations.
","Lebanon is the master of hospitality among the Arab world. Its hospitality schools, and universities are considered as the basic source for all the hospitality institutions around the region. Based on all these characteristics of Lebanon, and its people, I think it is important to conduct an eco-tourism project of this importance here, and consider Lebanon as the starting point to expand into other countries of the regions.","With the rapid awareness of enivronmental friendly activities in lebanon, we would estimate a 15% annual growth of the market.","Future Investments funding: 250,000$/year.","Since PILOT HOTEL will be the pioneer in this line of business, we are planning to capture 40% of the market share in the first 5 years.","It is estimated the average room rate is 130$, and an assumed 3% inflation rate has been applied going forward to the year 2015.We shall also have 8,447,000$ of gross operating income",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,,,

We have chosen to import a wide range of products from high-tech and electronics, to home appliances, toys, office equipments, accessories, and more. Our selection will be based on innovation and creativeness rather than specific and conventional type of products. Product choices will be tailored depending on new and specific consumer needs, country, and culture in which we are operating.","Since we plan on being a wholesale company, our target clients will be retailers such as malls (ABC, BHV, Le Mall), supermarkets (Spinneyâ€™s, TSC plus), outlets, home furniture stores, electronic stores, bookstores, and other retail places depending on the respective product weâ€™re selling. ","We will first start by operating in the Lebanese market from the North to the South regions. After being well established in Lebanon, we plan on expanding our business to the Middle East region.","We estimate the market is about 1,105 Million USD annually, and that we will have around 2.5 % of the market share as in market sales.","Our competitors include every wholesaler or distributor that offers similar products and responds to the same consumer needs. These products can be either locally manufactured or imported from foreign countries.","Our products will be hold two main competitive advantages over competitive firms which are selling similar products. First, innovation; our objective is to chose among millions of Chinese products, the ones that are the most creative and useful for mass consumption. We will be the first company to introduce them to the market, and therefore we will possess complete advantage over our competitors. Second, since we chose Chinese-made products, our prices will be relatively low to competitive products that are sold in the same retails stores. Thus, Price and Innovation will be the two pillars of our company. ","2 pickups = 30,000 USD.","Salaries = 2,000 USD ; Fuel + electricity + utilities = 3,000 USD; Products + Shipment = 75,000 USD",---,---,"Since no exclusivity law in the Lebanese market and competition is quite fierce, we might not be able to maintain our advantage for too long, and we believe that if our products seem promising to our competitors, we will not be able to maintain our advantage for more than 12 months. Therefore we will have to always differentiate ourselves by looking for new ideas and importing creative products to the market in order to please the customer and maintain our relationships with our clients.","24 months: With the presence of a warehouse, our company does require or carry with it huge fixed costs; for that reason, it will take us more or less one year to break-even the total of 110,000 USD investment we have made.","Four to Five months:
 -    1 month to find good suppliers and settle the contracts
-     2 months for the production
-     1 to 2 months for shipment
","Well-established businesses that have been for a long time in the market have lower unitary cost (due to our relatively higher start-up costs), this might increase the competition between us.
Since we cannot remove the start-up cost, we can build a strong marketing campaign, and hire experienced staff in the field and train them well in order to eliminate that risk.
Another constraint is the easy entry to the market from any competitor, therefore we will keep on tracking new and innovative products in order to always keep this competitive edge.

The study consisted of identifying dissected areas that are targeted for our product positioning, and discerning the nature of the market in terms of the Brands exposed in that area, the pricing affiliated to them, the social nature of the targeted audience. It also included the spending habits of the customers in that area, projecting potential income generated in that market, detecting marketing activities that future rivals are engaged in, and the market share of each of the competitors with the accorded SWOT analysis.",,,,,,,,,"Outsourced collection of apparels and accessories of the most updated fashion in the world, targeting young and middle age adults.

For that to happen in a continuous competitive advantage:
â€¢	Conduct weekly researches Online and in the local market (stores, magazines, fashion shows etcâ€¦) after spotting the nucleus source of fashion generators. These researches should be assessed on specific criteria and reported thoroughly to the purchasing manager. It is crucial to keep track of all updates of Fashion. (Seasonâ€™s trends, colors, pricing portfolio, prospects feedback etcâ€¦)  This will represent the Marketing intelligence, one of the most vital and affective sections of the decision-making process. It should be handled by experienced professionals with an insight on the companyâ€™s overall mission.

â€¢	Spot exclusive sources of high quality wears for modest pricing. Finishing is the most important criteria with the source designation, that is, after granting the quality elegance and effectiveness.
Potential sources could be locally, Europe (Italy, Turkey, and France) and Far East.
To settle with exclusive suppliers and initiate a long term relationship with them, testing of the material and their work should be very accurate and basic based on sampling and mini orders; it should include testing areas such as:

With its built-in business advisor, eldaftar can help SMBs owners in understanding the consequences of their management decisions in addition to enabling them to manage their business more effectively and profitably. In addition to eldaftar available vertical solutions, eldaftar could be branded and integrated with other readymade business partners solutions (Vodafone Egypt â€œelmodeerâ€ business case).

",,,,,,,,,"First production year should be highly dedicated to software development. Entry barrier is not high which poses a continuous threat that needs to be addressed continuously through tremendous efforts to keep the product on the top. lots of effort should be done to deliver innovative application add-ons, new features and focus on customer stickiness specially in the first six months of customer adoption.","The value proposition is to deliver reliable cloud-based IT solutions for SMB at an affordable cost with no infrastructure requirements. The challenge for SMBs to advance from an IT perspective is to start acquiring the needed infrastructure such as servers, network and needed applications. Seeking international solutions doesnâ€™t help because of the language barrier as well as the local culture needs from different perspectives such as accounting standards (examples competing are quicken and Peachtree). eldaftar and potential new nhanc offerings will dramatically reduce the cost, headache and effort to run a reliable IT solution for this market.",,,"nhanc will focus on three primary markets during 2011-2012. These markets are Egypt, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. As the initial local market, the SMB market size in Egypt is not officially quantified due to varying data from different government sources.. The unofficial forecasts are in the range of 500,000 SMBs in major cities. The Egyptian ICT indicators portal indicates that business including SMBs who are using the internet reached 35% by July 2009. Sub segmentation of the SMBs in each market is another needed step to help in positioning eldaftar correctly. These sub-segments are expected to be small (0-25 employees), medium (26-50 employees) and large (51-99 employees). Each of these will require a significant level of variation on the online platform and a smooth transition from one step to the other in catering the exponential growth of any successful SMB.",,,"nhanc is promoting eldaftar using a selective distribution channel model to achieve its goal of generating profitable and sustainable revenue stream. This model could be classified into two types according to the target segment:-

1)For SME, the business model for the platform
â€¢	Long term monthly subscription fees 
â€¢	Platform add-ons as major revenue stream

2)For Large enterprise, the business model for the platform
â€¢	Advertising to eldaftar SME customers as a revenue source
â€¢	Eldaftar extension agreements (Distribution and Order Management) ex. Unilever, P&G
â€¢	Analytics reporting revenue",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,,,7

",,"Our service is new to the Egyptian market yet an indirect competition comes from the big retailers"" discount /loyalty cards. Web based discounts in Egypt are very limited to very specific segments like fast food, therefore can""t be considered as direct competitors.",,,,"24 months - Our objective will be to expand the market and grow with it .It is still a new market in Egypt and the further this market grows the more we will grow with it as we will be the single player in the market for a significant time (expected to be 24 months). Even if other  competitors try to enter the market later on, we will still be the market share leaders (>40%)","a. Consumers: Our Company provides consumers with their choice of discount coupons absolutely free; we will even pay the postage. Thus we participate in providing their principle goods in better prices.
b. Manufacturers/Marketers: The marketer pays a fixed fee to feature a brand on our company, plus few piasters for each coupon printed and mailed. The greatest benefit for marketers is reaching their targeted consumer by spending money in the right place instead of spending big amounts of money in advertising to the whole market.
c. Retailers: There are many benefits for the retailers where a fee is paid by our company for coupons redeemed at the retailer""s stores. In addition to the discounted amounts paid to retailers against collection of the coupons. Also, the idea where the consumer should go to the retailer""s store to redeem his coupon will definitely increase the consumer""s impulsive shopping leading to more revenues for retailers.
","Our business model is new to the Egyptian market. Introducing a free service will cause doubts that would disappear gradually as soon as the consumer receives his first coupons. Providing personal data prior to registration might hinder some cautious consumers, but the sponsorship by major manufactures will mitigate that fear. Attempts to receive more coupons with faked redundant accounts will lead to data manipulation affecting supplied data to the manufacturers. This can be overcome through filtering registered users and banning any manipulating users. Fraud of our coupons to benefit from the discounts on the products is another risk that would need using extra security measures.",,"Initially, we shall operate in urban areas only, specifically major cities like Cairo, and Alexandria respectively. Other major cities can be considered in the future. This is enforced by the fact that part of our supply chain depends on retailers, specifically large retailers that are able to provide a redeeming service for our coupons. Such retailers only exist in major cities, mostly in Cairo. In addition, the highest population with the highest expenditure exists in Cairo.
We shall target the female working segment in Egypt; especially that in the Egyptian society, women are the economic figures in the family and the financial organizers of home resources. Age segmentation would range from age 20 to 35 years old. This age range is most interested in the saving concept and is detected to be constant users to the internet. By time and as the idea grows; the targeted age range is expected to exceed 35 years. Our income segmentation will be a huge proportion of class B, yet our service can also attract a significant proportion of Class A, even if their aim was just joining the new trend rather from benefiting from the saving process. A small upper proportion of Class C can also be taken into consideration; this proportion is looking forward to being part of the B class, so the hypermarket shopping process can be very appealing for them, as well as the benefits of logging to the internet and economically benefiting from this.","We believe that we will break even after 22 months, selling a total of 362,134 units.",,"- Ali""s Answer",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,"Capitalize on being one of the first web based marketing companies to target the business market by introducing new techniques and promotions.

The other indirect competitors will rise from the fact that the low level of awareness the Palestinians society  regarding environmental issues and the initial costs resulting for example as people will have to pay about 20% extra cost and need to get the money back within 3-5 years by saving in running cost for using the renewable energy, this will make some clients go back to traditional non-eco friendly techniques.

finally, this is the main idea and the other details will be developed with the business plan and the main challenge is that no one developed this kind of turbine before so it is the first invention. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,"electrical power",,6

Even though each company has a company website that describes their products and services, and usually each company has their own ERP system, this is far from enough. They need to ""Go Digital"" across the entire business value chain starting with the consumer, all the way back to the manufacturing process. Going digital is a much talked about word nowadays, but in order to make the best out of digital, you need to bring together multidisciplinary knowledge, expertise and world class execution. Going digital is not just about procuring the latest and state of the art IT systems. 

""Digitize Arabia"" will help you through every step of the process of going digital, be it in digitizing your companyâ€™s operations, creating an online strategy, going online, and managing your ongoing digital campaign from end to end. 

""Digitize Arabia"" team follows a 360 degree approach and has a team with extensive business and marketing knowledge that enables us to see beyond the technical aspects of going online, and in identifying where the real opportunities are. We will create an entire Business Transformation plan across all functions in your organization in order to:
* Standardize, simplify and automate processes and systems
* Dramatically reduce time to market 
* Create a digital workforce and digital work environment
* Equip your organization to better deal with online customers, online suppliers and online  influencers

Due to the increase of the number of carriers in the region, especially low-cost airlines, there has been an increase demand for a tool that will allow the customers to compare fairs and book the cheapest. 

@Sama is an innovative portal that will integrate with all the airlines in the region. ",,"The global competitors such as expedia.com, kayak.com, and cheaptickets.com are only integrated with the more established carriers. However, the price sensitive users are more interested in comparing fares from the low-cost carriers. Also, most of the customers who use the standard carriers have more brand loyalty, and are not sensitive to price. 

We have identified this gap, and have surveyed 500 customers from all over the middle east, and the response was very promising. They all said that they will buy from @sama as long as we don""t add a service charge to the price.  

Here is a very interesting statistic. The volume of eCommerce transactions in the Arab World during 2009 was slightly above 1 Billion US Dollars. Quit a big number, however more than 50% of this amount is actually airline tickets. This proves that most customers like to buy their tickets online, its a great opportunity ! ",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Our geographic target Market is the Arab World, with a special focus on the GCC. 

Our target customer persona is as follows: 
- Price sensitive
- Works in a country other than his/her own 
- Between the age of 25 and 50 years of age. 
- Might be single or married. 

",,,"Our revenue model will be in the form of a flat fee commission from the airlines. Airlines are already giving travel agencies commissions, and they wouldn""t mind giving @sama the same commission. 

This revenue model is well established in the global markets and works really well. The customers end up getting great prices, and don""t have to pay more. 

Consider the following: Southwest Airlines a well established US airline has a market capitalization of $3 Billion US dollars. Cheaptickets.com a company that uses the same revenue model that @Sama will use has a market cap of $15 Billion US Dollars in the Nasdaq exchange. ",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,"The innovation that @Sama brings is related to how it will integrate with the new low-cost airlines that have been appearing lately in region specially in the GCC. 

Our tools will support XML integration with cron-job updates, in addition to manual integrations with Legacy systems.

Many people that ive met through all these years have shown a great deal of interest in the taste these nuts have and i believe opening a store under the real name which is ""Tavazo Nuts"" would really grab peoples attention as well as showing the Iranian culture in decorating the shop so it would be a diverse idea towards peoples eyes such as europeans, Arabs, americans, ect...

In a similar light, any parking or traffic ticket a citizen receives must be paid in person at a specific government office.  In our view, this is inefficient for the citizens and costly for both the citizens and government alike.  We propose to contract with government entities such as the utility company and the traffic patrol office to set up an online service for citizens to pay their utility bills and parking tickets.  This would be a major convenience for the citizens, and it would be very cost effective for the government as the online platform would cut the costs typical in a brick and mortar operation (rent, utilities, labor, etc).",,"We have spoken to many Jordanians who agree that it is much simpler and more effective to log on to the internet and pay a bill than it is to drive to a local office and wait in line, only to do the same.  We have studied the market in the United States where similar services exist.  Most importantly, we are in discussions with executives at the incumbent Jordan utility regarding the possibility of offering this service.",,"Market growth is best estimated by nominal GDP growth, which is roughly 3.2%.  This number is further compounded by the dramatic increase in internet penetration (it more than doubled from 2007 to 2009 and is expected to reach 50% by the end of 2011).","Through discussion with various software developers, as well as our knowledge of programming, server maintenance, and hosting from previous work on internet businesses, we estimate the costs as follows:

Programming costs: $37,500; we reach this number by multiplying 500 hours of programming, testing, security testing, etc. by the $75 rate we would pay for top of the market programmers

Server fees: $1,000 a month for a dedicated server whereby 99.99% uptime is guaranteed.

Marketing expense: $20,000; because incentives are aligned with the government in that costs are reduced when citizens pay their bills online, the utility and traffic authority will promote the service.  This alleviates our marketing expense, but test campaigns could be beneficial.
",,"The greatest potential competitor would be the government itself if it chose to operate the online service on its own as opposed to outsource it. It would not be in the interest of the government to do so given the cost savings and efficiency of outsourcing information technology (IT) processes.",,,,"The competitive advantage will be maintained only by cooperation with the government to be the incumbent supplier of this online service.  Otherwise, barriers to entry are low and other companies can offer their own software at a lower commission for citizens to pay their bills.  Only by partnering with local governments and being regarded as the dominant, incumbent supplier will success build upon success and prevent entry of competition.","The competitor, or status quo of going somewhere to make a payment, is inefficient, inconvenient, and outdated.  Secure online payments will transform several bothersome errands into a few clicks.","The electrical company, government, and other organizations receiving payments may eliminate the middle man (us) and offer secure online payment services directly to the customer.  By creating a single portal for all payments, however, we reduce this risk.",,"The target country is initially Jordan, a country in which we were born and have knowledge of local customs as well as relationships with people in various industries.  The business has ability to expand, but unbridled growth will be detrimental.  Instead, we wish to focus in Jordan first, and become the dominant (hopefully only) service supplier to the government, thus creating barriers to entry for competitors.

Our target customers are the population of Jordan that receives an electricity bill or parking ticket and has easy access to the internet. Currently, internet penetration is over 36% and rapidly rising.
","Thanks for your consideration!","For the electrical bill component:
Population of Jordan: 6 million people
Households in Jordan: ~1 million
Internet users: 1,741,000
Internet penetration: 36%
People paying bills each month: 360,000
Average bill: $60 dollars
Total yearly bill payment: 360,000 * $60 * 12 months = $259,200,000
Commission (2%): 2% of $259,200,000 = $5,184,000","We will earn a commission of 2% or so from each transaction.  We are in the process of calculating the total costs for the government to offer a standard bricks and mortar operation with desk attendants to serve the population.  Because this business is only viable if the government a) chooses to allow an online platform and b) chooses to have it outsourced, the price (i.e., our commission) must be lower than its current cost to serve the community.",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,"It is a mainstay of Jordanian life to head to a government office, a post office, or bank each month to pay the electricity bill.  It is also a fact of life that any parking or traffic violation must be resolved in person.  Our service would simplify this process as citizens would be afforded the opportunity to pay their bills or tickets online.

The convenience to the citizenry is obvious, and so is the cost effectiveness to the government.  An online portal could eliminate many jobs where government employees serve the long lines of people waiting to pay a bill.  Instead, these employees can be moved to other jobs in other areas of the economy where they can potentially have a higher productivity.  Of course the cost to the government would be a fraction of the value of each transaction.  But the savings would exceed the cost: one study in the United States valued the cost of processing an online transaction at a mere $1.60 as opposed to the $6.60 it cost for a counter transaction.  Instead of paying rent, electricity, labor, etc., the government would instead pay a fraction of each transaction.  Furthermore, in addition to reducing costs, this service has the potential to increase government revenues, as many people simply do not pay parking tickets due to the time and hassle associated with doing so.","When the website is fully operational, citizens will utilize the service as soon as they learn about it.  Few people would prefer to take a drive to pay a bill rather than go online and pay it in a few easy clicks.",7

3)study the possibility to see how the islamic banks could be etablished in europe

a) which countries has the best economic environemment for islamic banks ?

b) what economic and legal obstructions stand in the way of islamic banks to make their etablishment on the european ground ?

c) studying the project to etablish a belgian islamic bank to receive deposits of muslim people without interest

d)make connections with worlwide universities teaching islamic finance to allow future students to study over there.

e) study the possibility for new islamic products ",,"1) We have been studying the legal environment in Belgium
2) we made research on the different universites teaching islamic finance
3) we have made some research on economic environment in belgium 
4) we have asked some people from all levels to see if they would be interested by putting their money in islamic banks
5) we have asked to some specialist in charia, in economics, in finance, in law, if they would collaborate with us once the ecif will be etablished.

6)we made some research to see if this project has been created by someone else",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,"the idea of  creating the ECIF is very innovative because in europe , we don""t have acces to islamic finance.

Muslim people keep thinking that the only way to make projects and create companies in belgium or europe , is to ask money from occidental banks.

they also think that nowadays, wa can not survivre in this occidental society without being involved in loans with interest.

They have a poor knowledge on islamic finance. Some people would like to know more about islamic finance but all books are written in english or in arabic. Some people too would like islamic banks to handle and to take care of their money.

But infortunately, we have no banks involved in islamic finance.

Our contribution is to make easier the access to islamic finance and why not to create a small islamic bank.

another contribution will be to create a database for all people willing to make investments on financial markets.

further,a significative contribution is to prepare, giving advices to people who want to study islamic finance abroad and why not giving foundation courses.

thiss project could be launched thanks to the winning price.",,finance

Thirdly, the other Arab countries, and finally, the Michigan, United States, Munich Germany and other areas of the western countries which have high Muslim populations who speak English, Arabic, or German.
Target customers are: firstly, young (and young at heart) Muslimas from puberty to 40 who live in the hot climates of the Muslim-dominated world and who are required to wear (or who desire to wear) modest clothing.  Secondly, we would target western, Filipino and Russian women who want to be fashionable and yet modest, because they are married to Muslims and required by their husbands to wear modest clothing.
The third target market is tourists who want to wear some ""traditional clothing"", and still be comfortable and attractive.
",,,"The primary source of level during the first 1-2 years of business will be franchise fees to female marketers who host home fashion shows and serve as marketing mouthpieces for the fashion.

Musharka Mutanaqessa) and the crowdfunding model. Therefore, it is based, from one hand, on  sharing profits and losses between Istedbaaâ€™s investment fund and the matched project. On another hand, it does not offer any returns on investment (ROI) except for the â€œcrowdâ€ who will get the product they crowdfunded . Of course the donors will not have any tangible ROI except the recognition of their sadaka. 

Therefore, our 3 main groups of clients (MSEs, product developers and the crowd) will only pay for results, and the fundamental upgrade in productivity and innovation due to Istebdaa"" services.

Istebdaaâ€™ will invest in the â€œmatchedâ€ projects with a maximum amount of 30.000 EGP, and up to 50% of the total costs involved in the operation. In other words, after that Istebdaaâ€™ links the demand with the supply of innovation/ideas/product design it will invest in these latter as long as the total capital needed does not exceed 60.000 EGP.
The rest of the capital for each â€œmatchedâ€ projects will be shared between the firm, product designer and/or online community crowdunding (consumers or donors). The fund will go to the project itself as an independent legal entity, neither to the firm nor to the product developers solely. This will insure an additional mutual risk management, takaful. 

Every repayment of capital by the entrepreneur will diminish the total capital ratio for Istebdaaâ€™ in the project, as well as profit shares. Profits from each project are shared between stakeholders (including Istebdaaâ€™) and the firm gradually buys Istebdaaâ€™s shares in the project and share them with the designers till they both own 100% of the project within a predetermined timeline. As for the e-Sadaka and e-consumersâ€™ contributions, they will be considered as part of the MSEâ€™ shares. Any Sadaka issuer will be able to track the multiplication of his Sadaka in different projects.

The repayment period is dependent upon the pre-agreed period. It should be suitable till the development of the product (grace period till the commercialization).
An example: A Fanous Made by Egyptians
Workshops in Hussein and elsewhere, who are facing an aggressive Chinese competition through the last decade, need to innovate and upgrade the value chain for their fawanees by a cost-effective mean. Istebdaa"" team will try to bring on the technical difficulties faced by those workshops and will look for solvers. 
Young innovators who might have funny and bright ideas for new forms of Fawanees. They can help workshops in adding some new functions in the products or a new production process for a better quality/price ratio. For instance, adding a new functionality to let it be useful even after the holy month ends.
As mentioned, our innovation system should be more demand-driven and based on the potential marketability and how to increase it. Therefore, Egyptian children must have a say and also contribute in the evolution of the Fanous. Throughout the portal, children and other internet-users will post ideas and suggestions for their Fanous. Through Crowdfunding, children""s parents will have the option to: (i) pay 10 LE as an e-Sadaka, (ii) pay 60 LE buy in advance the innovative fanous, and (iii) pay 120 LE and get a personalized fannous!
In addition, a contest could be organized in different regions of Egypt to let children draw the way they want their Fanous, and choosing among them the best designs.

Finally, the Fanous is the simplest example of how could we improve our economy by â€œinjectingâ€ more â€œknowledgeâ€ into it. The comeback of the Egyptian Fanous is only the beginning for a brighter future of our economy.
",,,,,,,,1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,"The Arab region is witnessing historical moments of change and hope; these youth-led movements are a clear illustration of what the synergy between youth and knowledge could do, from the one hand. Meanwhile, it has shown what societal risks can unemployment and hopelessness provoke. 
The current political change in Egypt would surely have many economic implications. The main economic challenges are, among others: (1) Fighting skilled youth unemployment , (2) Increasing the Egyptian workforce productivity  and (2) Upgrading the value-added and the marketability of the Egyptian products .
This needs an intermediation framework that matches the local societal needs, local knowledge with local and/or international markets. The main problem that is preventing any these factors from being matched was (1) the financial burden and more specifically the refusal of commercial banks to support such initiatives without any collateral, (2) the unclear perception of the innovative ideas demand & supply.

7%. The market is expected to grow because of the tremendous demand for dental biomaterial and dental implants. It
is expected that the market for dental implants and dental biomaterials will grow at an overall CAGR of 6% and
10.5% respectively from 2010 â€“ 2015.
The dental market size in Egypt is estimated at $50 million, in 2007. Traditionally, the Egyptian market is very
sensitive to prices rather than quality or high technology, but this trend is changing towards a major attention for
reliable equipment and quality products.
",,"*Direct Competitors: starting from 2009, there are 3 expensive devices ios3d, iTero and Lava, produced by 3 American companies but they have no agents in Egypt or in Middle East.

*Indiret Competitors: Several hundreds of dental labs that""ll produce the 3D hand-held models for the jaws and teeth manually with lack of accuracy and high cost in terms of money and effort",,,,"â€¢ Revenue Streams
Currently In Egypt, our expected customer dentist makes a 3D casted plaster frame about 2 or three times daily, and
each of these frames pay from LE 100 to 800 for each according to the plaster material and according to the part of
the jaw required to be made. And they also pays from LE 2000 to 5000 for a 3D modeling software with too much
features called â€œDolphinâ€ plus annual renewal fees from LE 500 to 1200.
The day we finish our first successful prototype, we start targeting the dental students in the Egyptian faculties with
our first by-products with special offers to build audience and try to get income cash flow so early. As we cover our
expenses and costs for, we""ll offer special invitations to access our services to special, highly-selected expected
customers then later through dental conferences start targeting medium class dentists then low class dentists with
special offers to their needs. In parallel to this, we""ll be building the supporting DICOM images viewer and 3D
modeling tool as prepaid web service on iPad and Android if needed.
","Our system takes some advantages over the competitors:
1. Efficiency: error is about 2-3 micrometer over manual plaster frames because of the hand-made errors and the normalization shrinkage factor of approximately 2-3 millimeter, less production cost in terms of money and time

2. It enables our customers using our system without buying expensive devices as our direct competitors through a prepaid web service (for getting the input medical images files and processing the 3D modeling) and delivery service (for the printed models) equivalent to our system.

3. We enable our customer integrating their iProducts (iPhone, iPad) and their Android to facilitate their interfacing our system and our services by developing iOS and Android clients.
","â€¢ Cost Structure
We are planning to reduce the cost as possible without sacrificing the quality as possible by depending on Hi-Tech
solutions like virtual offices, cloud computing back-end and so on. The most expensive key resources is the 3d
printers, and the most expensive key activities is the software development for the DICOM viewer and the 3D
modeler


Phase0: Construction= 1 month; Virtual office and infrastructure
Phase1: Prototyping = 3 to 4 months; first side product and the first income cash flow
Phase2: Beta = 15 to 20 months; more side-products and the occurrence of break-even point and the payback will be
near the end of this phase.
Phase3: Production = more; building the production line

We need about $15,000 to start prototyping and we can afford 15% of this cost currently",,"We""ll have 2 positive impacts on the community: The first is the efficiency; 
We target the effeciency of the professional life of our customers and save their resources; effort, time and money. The second is the environmental impact; 
PLAÂ  (Poly Lactic Acid) that""s used by our system as material to print in, made from corn starch or sugar and it is biodegradable. It is the most environmentally friendly material available for this type of 3D printing, not like the biohazard wastes used in the current manual dental impression.",,"Geographically; The Egyptian market is sensitive to the price more than the quality, which is a chance to get money
early before targeting the European, American or even the gulf market which requires achieving certain quality levels
that may not be easy during the launching period

Demographically; In 2007, There are about 27,000 dentists in Egypt and exceeds by 7500+ dentist yearly, and these
dentists are categorized according to their potentiality that""ll be detailed later.","Due to the need to the hand-held model, the dentists today make manual dental impression which is time-consuming process using special high-cost materials to take the shape of the teeth then takes hard shape to form plaster frame and the actual shape of the teeth are casted in it producing high errors in the dimensions in about 3 -4 mm due to the shrinkage factor for the plaster material and for the casted material",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,"The dentists deals with their medical images using their imagination which is NOT accurate all the time regarding the accurate dimensions of the real oral architecture, and the dentist may have more errors in imagining the unnatural cavities inside the jaw architecture. So our expected system 2thCloning (pronounced as ""Tooth Cloning"") will solve the dentists"" imagination problems, as our system takes panoramic dental X-Ray as input then it generates 3D model from the input so the dentist can rotate, zoom or cut any part of the model at any surface with any angle then the system prints the 3D model totally or partially as low-price plastic assembled and colored-layer hard copy as we call this process as ""tooth cloning"", the other service that we""ll introduce is the ""tooth manipulation"" which uses the eye of the device ""Digital Camera"" in watching the printed model in the hands of the dentist and defining it then rotating the software 3D model with the same angles with the same planes","Customer contact with several dentists who revealed their pain because of their problems and their needs",8

Rana Mahfouz: An undergraduate student in faculty of Pharmacy, CU. She is â€œThe entrepreneurâ€ who thinks â€œHow to do better?â€ not â€œHow to do?â€. She has a significant background in marketing and PR through playing various roles in student activities and initiatives including STP (Steps Towards Progress), Egypreneur and others.
Mahmoud Rashad: Graduated from faculty of Commerce, CU; and is now working as a social media specialist. Mahmoud is our numbers guy; heâ€™s responsible for the financial matters of Scienciety in addition to his close relation to social media thus ensuring an extensive knowledge of how to use the social media in marketing and how to improve our own Scienciety.
Ahmed Sherif: An undergraduate student in faculty of Engineering, CU. Ahmed is the web developer and the technological guru in our team. He is responsible for translating our ideas into reality and codes.
Salma Helmy: An undergraduate student in faculty of Pharmacy, CU. Salma is the driving force of the team. Having a pretty good HR background and the ability to communicate with whoever crosses her way, she is the one that keeps the team working, motivated and makes sure we are all on the same page.

The main competency in the team is the variation in skills, experience and technical background. All members of the team are related to either the targeted segment of Scienciety or the world of online media in general which provides valuable input by every member and helps us fit Scienciety to itâ€™s targeted segment.
",,,,,,,"We have direct competitors such as Laboratree, Mendeley, Academia; these websites are based on the somewhat similar idea of connecting researchers. 
We consider social networks as Facebook, Google Plus and Linkedin to be indirect competitors.",,,,,"Direct:What we believe will give us an advantage over these websites is:
Theyâ€™re not known in our primary targeted region, which is locally in Egypt.; the market is considered untapped.They are less comprehensive in their content while one of Sciencietyâ€™s main goals is saving time; the most important asset for researchers.
Scienciety, unlike competitors, is more about the data and less about the social network which fits, according to our preliminary research, into the paradigm of â€œScientists are not social, the data isâ€
Scienciety factors in the segment of beginners and students who have no experience in the field of research which was missed by our competitors.
Most importantly; Scienciety adds a very important part of the equation which is the funding and implementation of research. Our competitors stopped at conducting research but we believe that the purpose of research is to find solutions and actually solve, we believe that our â€œCrowd fundingâ€ tool gives us an important competetive edge.
Indirect:  Our advantage over them is the fact that Scienciety depends on the social data rather than social scientists and Scienciety provides researchers with what they specifically need in no time.",,,"Scienciety will cater to the needs of thesegment of researchers by various tools; a myriad of features to help researchers attain peer input, students to read and understand scientific journals for free, provide a coaching system, a comprehensive news feed in the latest in the customerâ€™s field of interest be it new papers, open course ware, scholarships, competitions or job vacancies, provide a platform for crowd funding and/or attracting investments and thatâ€™s just the beginning.  ",,"Target audience: Students and researchers in technical fields","The field of scientific research in our country faces a lot of obstacles, be them lack of
funding, lack of resources or simply lack of support and peer input. Students and young researchers in the various technical fields in Egypt, generally, lack the know,  how and the means of conducting research, searching for resources, finding guidance for development and implementing their solutions. ",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,"A scientifically oriented social network; specifically designed to form an interlinked society of solution finders and solution implementers. Our network will cater to the needs of researchers, investors and most importantly students interested in the various fields of developing sciences, and act as bridge to connect them all together. We will mainly act on forming communication channels between all the parties involved in the scientific research process; these parties are students, researchers and investors.
The network is going to provide the users many features to help fulfilling the objective of the website. The network is going to help the students and the young researchers to get systemic coaching from other more experienced researchers. Researchers with well developed and mature ideas will be able to find crowd funding for their ideas. On the other hand, Investors will be able to find the promising ideas that they are willing to fund.
Researchers will be provided by free simplified papers, videos and all required materials to let them conduct their researches efficiently.
Our network will significantly aid all those who can help solve problems to find each other and collaborate; by doing so many researchers can overcome various obstacles that face the field of scientific research in our country, be it lack of funding, lack of resources or simply lack of support and peer input. This community will lead to a great development in the researcher, and will get the whole research world together.

Obstacles:
The 1stÂ obstacle to face this project is the possibility of irresponsible people or dishonest individuals taking advantage of its nature that""s why there are a number of ways to disqualify those:
a)Â Â Â Â Â Â The rating system if I am asking for a ride or offering one I must depend on the feedback of the people who have already shared this kind of experience with me in both verbal comment and also numerical one that allows a person to give certain grades for time commitment and quality of behavior and financial obligation from the passenger side, edited by the driver.Â Â also for the driver rating there must beÂ Â certain grades for time commitment and quality of behavior andÂ Â quality of vehicleÂ Â and driving abilities etc.
b)Â Â Â Â Â Â But at the start this system wonâ€™t be up and runningÂ Â so the there must be another system that have the ability to secure those who start using it for the 1stÂ time or with a new person ,this system is a system that""s already up and workingÂ Â right now and it""s called the social networks , face book, twitter ,LinkedIn , yahoo ,live ,etc they will give the chance to both ends of car pooling to get to know each other before they start their arrangement , having the chance to see one""s family and children and share his photos and memories that""s something that can seriously help building confidence to start knowing him ,yet the most powerful feature that will use the social networks would be the indirect connection rides discovery ,which is meanly based on the fact of if I didn""t now my neighbor, then one of my neighbors probably know him, this feature uses my social network accounts parsing them in order to find one of my friends who know my carpooler or know a friend of him, depending on how many persons I am whiling to accept as the middle man between the two of us to organize the gathering.",,"10,000,000 after 1st year of launch","my system is scalable for the whole world to use not just 1 country, i expect to increase users by 9 million users / year",,"zimride company",,,,"Â Business model
also the gps technology have been quit common in our life for some time there is absolutely no ad related software to this divine technology ,even if it seems quit rationale to relate adds to places not to WebPages ,this application will allow us to collect a great revenue by three ways

Amakena""s simplistic design helps users work it in an intuitive way which minimizes it""s learning curve. The site adapts according to usage, categories are rearranged based on user preferences and category access frequency.

Amakena is an open platform, meaning users can add an interest category (e.g. Rare Coin collections) and invite people to join these categories. When a category gets enough activity to be considered ""popular"", it is enabled as one of the main categories of the site.

Amakena integrates with existing social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Google allowing users to use their existing identity on Amakena.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The most important factor for retailers is ""how to reach their target demographic in volume"". This is the main factor that affects their choice of location, marketing , expansion, etc. While some retailers have on-line stores, most of them are failing to utilize this channel, this is mainly because most retailers fail to realize that these types of Websites require constant marketing to drive growth and it can be as expensive as opening a brick and a mortar store.

Amakena makes use of the viral growth that characterizes social network sites and presents retailers and business owners with a great channel to reach their target demographics.

Retailers would simply catalog their products to create a virtual store called an â€œAStoreâ€. Each time a customer chooses to buy items from Amakena, AStores that contain these items are listed for the user to choose from. 

Amakena handles all logistical issues such as payment methods, shipment, etc. and creates a care free environment for the retailers to benefit from.",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,"With too many options on hand, how do people decide on which new places to try, which books to read, TV series to watch, Music to listen to, etc? We have conducted a survey on 375 people, in the 18 - 44 age group that shows that people usually rely on their friends, people who share the same taste, expert reviews and the public opinion (e.g. Best Sellers, Box Office, etc.) as a big factor of their decision making process.

Amakena is a social cataloging website that provides users with an easy way to organize and share their favourite interests like books, movies, TV series and music among others with their friends, write reviews, share ratings, get recommendations based on their personal preferences, meet others with similar taste, buy their favorite items and get them delivered in the comfort of their homes.",,4

De faÃ§on pragmatique, nous dÃ©velopperons une plateforme pilote pour le Maroc qui sera dÃ©ployÃ© par la suite sur les autres pays du Maghreb.",,1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,"Dans le contexte actuel marocain, nous considÃ©rons le moment propice pour la crÃ©ation dâ€™un agrÃ©gateur au Maroc.

Qu""est ce qu""un agrÃ©gateur :
Une plateforme internet ouverte qui fournit des informations actualisÃ©es sur des produits commercialisÃ©s par dâ€™autres fournisseurs (ci-dessous, exemple dâ€™alibaba.com).

Pourquoi un agrÃ©gateur au Maroc, maintenant?

Les indicateurs de lâ€™Ã©volution du marchÃ© Ã©lectronique marocain sont au vert et prÃ©sagent une croissance soutenue et soutenable :

1- Un chiffre dâ€™affaire avec des pourcentages dâ€™Ã©volutions Ã  3 chiffres : Le volume de transaction Ã©lectronique du marchÃ© Ã©lectronique marocain double tous les ans (actuellement de 700 millions de DHS).


2- Une bancarisation en hausse :
Un accroissement des pratiques monÃ©taires avec lâ€™augmentation du nombre des cartes bancaires en circulation, qui ont dÃ©passÃ© le seuil de 6,5 millions de cartes sous les labels Visa, MasterCard et CMI. 
Selon les statistiques du CMI, le volume de transaction bancaire a Ã©tÃ© multipliÃ© par 2,4 % en passant de 277.000 transactions contre 115.000 pour les six premiers mois de lâ€™annÃ©e 2010. 

3- Une augmentation rÃ©guliÃ¨re du nombre de site eCommerce : Le nombre de sites B2C a augmentÃ© de 30% en 2011 et les estimations d""Ã©volutions sont trÃ¨s optimistes pour les annÃ©es Ã  venir.

4- Lâ€™amÃ©lioration de la confiance numÃ©rique comme prioritÃ© nationale :
Des initiatives nationales sont en cours dâ€™exÃ©cution pour amÃ©liorer la confiance numÃ©rique dâ€™ici 2013 (cf. stratÃ©gie nationale pour la sociÃ©tÃ© de lâ€™information et de lâ€™Ã©conomie numÃ©rique): 
- Initiative 1 : Mettre Ã  niveau et renforcer le cadre lÃ©gislatif.
- Initiative 2 : Mettre en place les structures organisationnelles appropriÃ©es.
- Initiative 3 : Promouvoir et sensibiliser les acteurs de la sociÃ©tÃ© Ã  la sÃ©curitÃ© des systÃ¨mes dâ€™information.",,

Mr. Souheil Abboud, is the expert in set up new renewable energy companies, and will be responsible for preparing the business plan.
Mr. Salah Tabbara is the Commercial Expert, and would be responsible for the Marketing and Distribution.",,"This product is innovative because it has not yet been created to help the consumer save energy more efficiently and in a userfriendly way.",,"The size of the market is tremendous and estimated in the tens of Billion of dollars.
The business of renewable energy is constantly growing as the price of crude oil and energy is increasing.","The business is scalable as this product would have the potential to be sold internationally.
The estimated annual growth of this market exceed 5%.",,,,,,,,,,"This new product would help the environment by lowering the existing pollution due to fossil fuel as we are using clean energy from the Sun and wind.  The most important thing is to eventually create a factory to produce and assemble this product.  This would create much needed jobs and would also promote Research and development in the renewable energy sector.",,"The target market are the regular household users, could be a family of 4 or 5 who are in daily need of hot water, electricity, and cooling.  This is a very large segment of population.  The Ballerina system can be installed on roofs of high rise buildings very common around the world and is designed in such a way that it can provide full energy autonomy for existing and new dwellings that are far from electric public utilities.","THe problem we are trying to resolve is climate change by providing the consumer a way to utilize renewable energy in a more practical way.",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,"The Ballerina Energy System that is being developed at SES is to respond to the urgent need to lower greenhouse gas emissions from household users.    
This new product is made of a spherical sun receiver linked with a wind mill.  The Ballerina follows the sun for maximum efficiency.  It also has a dual flexible receiver that switches between a concentrated PV receiver or a hot black plate for water heating.  The windmill is located below the spherical receiver and is independent of the above system. The Ballerina base provides the brain of the system and has all the necessary controls namely: two large liquid reservoirs for hot and or/cold water storage.  A large set of batteries used to store electricity from the wind turbine and from the PV concentrated panel.  The base has also the inverter, and necessary pumps along with a general controller that would be linked to the household user showing him or her in real time how much the system is producing electricity and heat (hot/cold) and the amount of energy produced and stored.  The system can also communicate with other Ballerina""s and share energies (i.e. if one user of a house does not use all his electricity needs and has an excess), he or she can transfer this energy to another Ballerina, hence not only the optimization is on a micro-user but it could be expended to a community of users.  The name ""Ballerina"" was used to reflect its gracious sun tracking and simultaneous wind rotation with its flexibility to manage energy.
This product is a complete, efficient and smart renewable energy system that works during day and night.  It also combines heat storage and cold storage that could be done during the night using stored electrical energy or from wind.  The Ballerina controller decides when to produce heat/cold or when to produce electricity.  On a windy and cloudy day, the Ballerina may stop tracking the sun and position itself vertically for maximum wind energy production.  It""s built in anemometer and sun energy sensors, along with the existing energy storage system and user history would allow the Ballerina to decide how best to optimize the system for maximum energy supply.  The Ballerina is needed as it fills a need for consumers that are still undecided on what to purchase to cut down their energy needs.  Consumers are struggling whether to buy a Solar Water Heater or a stand alone PV panel system or Wind System.  Now they have the option to buy one system that optimizes all three.  The consumer does not have to worry anymore on what to buy as the Ballerina satisfies all his or her energy needs in a practical and simple way.

This is biotechnology in a very fundamental and environmentally friendly application.  It is based on using selected strains of actinomycetes that showed unique abilities in synthetic dyes degradation and heavy metals detoxification.  This method will be much less costly than the current physical and chemical treatment methods.  It will detoxify the heavy metals in the wastewater to harmless forms rather than creating a problematic solid waste that requires additional treatment before disposal. Additionally, and more environmentally important, the compounds that actinomycetes produce to break down the dyes are enzymes and proteins that themselves are easily broken down in nature to basic amino acids.

The amount of material adsorbed depends on a number of factors including: the degree of attraction of surface area exposed to mobile particles, the concentration of the contaminants, pH, and temperature of the liquid, the strongest adsorbents are microspores or finely divided solids  (Clays, charcoal, powdered metals); and liquids (fine droplets like aerosols and sprays).

The abilities of these strains for degrading a variety of synthetic hydrocarbons (polycyclic hydrocarbons, pentachlorophenol, phthalates, organochlorine pesticides, triphenylmethane dyes and azo dyes) as well as abilities for bioremoval of several heavy metals (cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, manganese, iron, nickel, zinc and lead) have been investigated. Selected strains facilitated complete mineralization of organic compounds, thus offered a potential for finding effective bioremediation agents for purifying contaminated environments (El-Shatoury, 2001; El-Shatoury, et al., 2004). Pathway and molecular basis of organochlorines degradation as well as mechanisms of chromium removal by actinomycetes consortium has been worked out (El-Shatoury, et al., 2005; Diab, et al., 2007; Abdulla, et al., 2009; Kamal, 2009).","export and import water

2)	Les Ã©coles et les universitÃ©s ne sont pas obligÃ©es Ã  payer les licences pour chaque ordinateur et pour chaque application et pour chaque systÃ¨me installÃ© comme la cas de Windows mais plutÃ´t, elles vont accÃ©der au service par une application standard facilement disponible, la plupart du temps un navigateur Web et la facturation se fait  uniquement lorsque il y a une utilisation et pas tout le temps  (câ€™est le modÃ¨le Cloud Computing) ce qui aboutit Ã  un gain financier trÃ¨s grand pour les gouvernements africaines.

3)	Lâ€™hÃ©bergement de la solution Â« RÃ©volution OS Â» sera dans le Cloud, ce qui rÃ©duit considÃ©rablement lâ€™Ã©nergie utilisÃ© dans lâ€™entreprise et les organismes publiques et par suite rÃ©duit lâ€™Ã©mission de CO2 et les gaz Ã  effet de serre parce ce que toute lâ€™infrastructure (serveurs, services, logiciels et hardware) sera du ressort d""un fournisseur expÃ©rimentÃ© comme  Â« Tunisie TelecomÂ», ou Â« Google Â», ou Â« Amazona Â» qui offrent un niveau rigoureux de la sÃ©curitÃ© et la fiabilitÃ© dâ€™infrastructure.

5)	Les utilisateurs (les universitÃ©s et les Ã©coles) ne sont plus gÃ©rant de leurs serveurs informatiques mais peuvent accÃ©der de maniÃ¨re Ã©volutive Ã  de nombreux services en ligne sans avoir Ã  gÃ©rer l""infrastructure sous-jacente, souvent complexe, et câ€™est ce quâ€™on appelle lâ€™informatique dÃ©matÃ©rialisÃ© moderne (Cloud Computing).

On veut ajouter des informations concernant la partie Recherche et dÃ©veloppement et les normes appliquÃ©s au sein de notre entreprise Â« Reliance Tunisie Â» :

ï¶	Recherche & dÃ©veloppement : Â« Reliance Tunisie Â» cherche Ã  sâ€™intÃ©grer avec les Ã©coles et les universitÃ©s pour renforcer son activitÃ© de rechercher et dÃ©veloppement.

","Â« Reliance Tunisie Â» va se concentrer exclusivement sur le Cloud Computing et le Â« Software as a service Â» ce qui permet de fournir accÃ¨s Ã  nos produits et solutions Ã  travers un espace de travail virtuel dÃ©matÃ©rialisÃ©. Notre marchÃ© cible va prioriser les opÃ©rateurs tÃ©lÃ©phonique, les fournisseurs de santÃ© public et privÃ©e, le domaine gouvernementale notamment comme lâ€™open Government et lâ€™Open Data  et bien sur le domaine de lâ€™Ã©ducation et la protection de lâ€™environnement.","Le secteur des Logiciels et Services doit jouer un rÃ´le majeur pour mesurer la performance de dÃ©veloppement durable, environnementale en particulier, mÃªme un bureau dâ€™Ã©tude possÃ¨de des impacts nÃ©gatifs sur lâ€™environnement, a quoi bon parler des organismes, Ã©coles et des universitÃ©s africaines qui utilisent une infrastructure informatique et logistique importante (ordinateurs, serveurs, applications, licences des produits, utilisateurs, etc.).

Cette infrastructure traditionnelle est toujours trop compliquÃ©e et onÃ©reuse et surtout trÃ¨s chÃ¨re, je cite Ã  titre dâ€™exemple le contrat fait par lâ€™ancien gouvernement tunisien et Microsoft, 5 ans de licence dâ€™utilisation de Windows dans les universitÃ©s et les Ã©coles pour 20 millions de dinars ! Aussi le contrat fait par Tunisie Telecom et Microsoft, un Million de dinar pour uniquement une licence de 600 utilisateurs, sans prendre en compte les prix de licence des autres produits. 

Donc Ã  quoi bon de parler des pays africaines les plus pauvres parce ce que ces pays ont besoin de faire un progrÃ¨s dans le domaine de lâ€™Ã©ducation et la protection de lâ€™environnement sans perdre beaucoup dâ€™argent, ils ont besoin aussi dâ€™offrir Ã  leur peuple une infrastructure informatique moderne, Ã©cologique, indÃ©pendante des grands constructeurs informatique et aussi avec bas prix.

Donc, En tenant compte des problÃ¨mes de lâ€™Ã©ducation et la pollution dans certaines pays africaines et en partant de tous ses problÃ¨mes liÃ©s Ã  lâ€™Ã©cologie et la protection de lâ€™environnement et la rÃ©duction des coÃ»ts dans les Ã©coles et les universitÃ©s dâ€™Afrique, on prÃ©sente lâ€™idÃ©e dâ€™un systÃ¨me dâ€™exploitation web, Ã©cologique en ligne nommÃ© Â« RÃ©volution OS Â».

Lâ€™intÃ©rÃªt de la solution Â« RÃ©volution OS Â» dÃ©passe le cadre de la crÃ©ation dâ€™une simple application Web ou dâ€™un systÃ¨me d""exploitation proposÃ© Ã  distance (ce quâ€™on appelle virtualisation) mais plutÃ´t lâ€™intÃ©rÃªt est de concevoir un nouveau concept dâ€™applications Ã©cologiques centralisÃ©es accessibles nâ€™importe oÃ¹ et nâ€™importe comment Ã  travers un navigateur classique ou un simple tÃ©lÃ©phone portable contrairement aux systÃ¨mes dâ€™exploitations classiques actuel.

Ce types dâ€™applications fournissent les fonctionnalitÃ©s basiques pour les utilisateurs (suite bureautique, outils de collaboration, navigation, stockage des fichiers, etc.), elles ne nÃ©cessitent pas une licence dâ€™achat ! (le bonheur pour les gouvernements africaines) et elles sont extensibles, c""est-Ã -dire, on peut installer dâ€™autres applications dedans comme sâ€™il sâ€™agit un ordinateur classique.

En effet, Les Ã©coles et les universitÃ©s ne seront pas obligÃ©es de payer les licences pour chaque ordinateur et pour chaque application et pour chaque systÃ¨me installÃ© comme la cas de Windows mais plutÃ´t, les Ã©tudiants et les Ã©coliers vont accÃ©der Ã  leurs applications basiques (traitement bureautique, stockages, recherche, collaboration etc.) Ã  travers une application standard facilement disponible, la plupart du temps un navigateur Web et lâ€™utilisateur va payer uniquement lors de son utilisation de ce systÃ¨me dâ€™exploitation (ModÃ¨le du Cloud Computing) ce qui aboutit Ã  un gain financier trÃ¨s grand pour les gouvernements tunisiennes et africaines.

De plus, Lâ€™hÃ©bergement de cette solution sera dans le Cloud, ce qui rÃ©duit considÃ©rablement lâ€™Ã©nergie utilisÃ© dans les universitÃ©s et les Ã©coles et les organismes publiques et par suite il y aura une rÃ©duction majeure de lâ€™Ã©mission de CO2 et les gaz Ã  effet de serre parce ce que toute lâ€™infrastructure (serveurs, services, logiciels et hardware) sera du ressort d""un fournisseur

Yehia Badawy â€“ Finance and Logistics
Yehiaâ€™s bachelor degree in accounting together with his background in construction related businesses render him an ideal member of this project. His experience with logistics and construction accounting allow him to efficiently develop and analyze the projectâ€™s business plan and feasibility study. ",,"The product is innovative because to this day, no one provides turn-key finishing and furnishing in our society. Additionally, there is a specific lack of focus when it comes to low-middle income housing. With the changes that have occurred in the region, we believe a middle class will begin to surface, a class that will be aspiring to obtain modern and classic design concepts and interior finishing at affordable prices.
Additionally, the project provides a material service that is usually time consuming and exhausting, in a manner that conforms with the nature of todayâ€™s young society: fast, affordable and efficient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The project will have several positive impacts on society, namely:
1. With any developing economy, people seek more automation and turn-key solutions to be able to devote more time to their jobs, which will become increasingly challenging. Our project allows youth the utilize their time more efficiently by effectively outsourcing the finishing and furnishing process in a reliable timely turn-key manner.

2. The project will enhance the skills and efficiency of local furniture workers, creating more jobs in the industry, and streamlining its performance to meet consumer demand.

3. By offering cheap financing, the project will allow low-middle income youth to contribute more actively to economic growth by stimulating purchases of appliances, construction materials, and other items needed for the finishing process.  ",,,"The problems we are addressing are:
1. The inability of today""s young society to be able to finance their residences"" finishing and furnishing. The ability to finance furniture does exist in a limited fashion, however, because finishing is usually completed by small, semi-formal companies, financing is usually not an option.

2. The lack of space-saving and efficient furniture that complies with the limited spaces available to today""s low-middle income youth. Floor space is expensive, and furniture in the region has not yet adapted to match the increasingly demanding needs of consumers.

3. The availability of skilled furniture workers that have no access to smart designs, while their skill levels can be commendable.

4. The time-consuming process that is finishing and furnishing a house or an apartment, which is faced by many low-middle income newly-weds, who are usually torn apart between their daily obligations and the errands that come with finishing and furnishing a house. Additionally, the process may be elongated by lack of funds, which is also a major issue faced by many youth, and one that can be easily solved by cheap financing.",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,"The idea behind our project is to provide turn-key finishing and furnishing for low to middle income housing. Utilizing modern concepts and space saving designs, coupled with local mass production, cheap and semi-skilled construction labor, we would be able to provide quality interior finishing at competitive prices.

Ali sera responsable de dÃ©finir la stratÃ©gie de l""entreprise Ã  tous les niveaux. Il effectuera cela de concert avec le reste de l""Ã©quipe.
Nour Nesh-Nash est une jeune diplÃ´mÃ©e de grande Ã©cole de commerce fraÃ§aise, elle apportera la vision commerciale et la gestion administrative (RH, budget, etc.) nÃ©cessaire Ã  la rÃ©ussite du projet.

Les diffÃ©rences complÃ©mentaires de nos profils nous amÃ¨nent Ã  croire que nous disposons de toutes les compÃ©tences pour mener Ã  bien ce projet. Les points communs sont multiples, le principal Ã©tant l""enthousiasme que nous avons pour rÃ©aliser ce projet.",,"Des Ã©quivalents du produit proposÃ© existent dÃ©jÃ  dans les pays dâ€™Europe, en Chine et en AmÃ©rique. Le produit est innovant par le marchÃ© auquel il sâ€™adresse, qui est le marchÃ© marocain qui ne dispose pas dâ€™un agrÃ©gateur fiable, visible et concentrant une large gamme dâ€™offres dans son contenu. Lâ€™innovation rÃ©side dans la proposition au marchÃ© marocain dâ€™un produit qui nâ€™existe pas encore localement dans ce pays.

Les achats Ã©lectroniques sont en dÃ©veloppement au Maroc. Lâ€™Ã©conomie et la sociÃ©tÃ© marocaines ont connu des changements notables dans leurs comportements dâ€™achat ces derniÃ¨res annÃ©es et les habitudes tendent Ã  Ã©voluer comme dans le modÃ¨le occidental vers une consommation et des achats sur internet de plus en plus marquÃ©e.

NÃ©anmoins, si lâ€™accÃ¨s a internet et les moyens de paiement informatiques se sont largement dÃ©mocratisÃ©s au cours des derniÃ¨res annÃ©es les sites internet sont encore a la traine et il nâ€™existe pas Ã  lâ€™heure actuelle dâ€™agrÃ©gateur reconnu permettant aux consommateurs de comparer et dâ€™effectuer des achats de produits divers sur internet au Maroc, les sites existants Ã©tant trÃ¨s limites en termes de qualitÃ© du contenu et en termes de visibilitÃ©. Le produit qui est proposÃ© ici est innovant parce quâ€™il sâ€™appuie sur les modÃ¨les dâ€™agrÃ©gateurs occidentaux leaders sur leurs marches en sâ€™appuyant sur les spÃ©cificitÃ©s locales pour rÃ©pondre au besoin actuel des marocains dÃ©sireux dâ€™effectuer des recherches et des achats de produits sur internet. Le produit tel quâ€™il est conÃ§u est novateur et nâ€™a pas de concurrent direct au Maroc de faÃ§on spÃ©cifique et au sein des pays du Maghreb en gÃ©nÃ©ral.",,"Le volume du marchÃ© Ã©lectronique  Ã©tait de 70 millions de $ en 2011 (source MCI).
Ce chiffre est surestimÃ© car il prend Ã©galement en compte les transactions de paiements Ã©lectroniques Maroc TÃ©lÃ©com, Lydec, etc.. La MCI ne fournit pas de chiffres officiels Ã  ce sujet.
Etant donnÃ© cette incertitude et le marchÃ© Ã©lectronique marocain qui reste embryonnaire au vu de lâ€™importance de ces sociÃ©tÃ©s dans lâ€™Ã©conomie marocaine, nous estimons que le ratio des transactions Ã©lectronique est entre 80 et 90%.
Sur la base de cette hypothÃ¨se, le marchÃ© Ã©lectronique marocain Ã©tait donc de 14 millions de $ en 2011.
Les analyses prÃ©visionnelles indiquent que le taux de croissance sera Ã  3 chiffres pour les 4 prochaines annÃ©es Ã  venir. Cette croissance prÃ©vue est confirmÃ©e par lâ€™analyse comparative du ratio volume du marchÃ© Ã©lectronique / PIB qui reste relativement faible au Maroc.",,,"Il n""existe pas de compÃ©titeur direct dans le panorama internet actuel des pays du Maghreb.
A date, il n""existe aucun agrÃ©gateur web dans le paysage internet marocain.
Les compÃ©titeurs  indirects sont les suivants :

- Des moteurs de recherche qui fournissent un accÃ¨s direct Ã  des site eCommerce (Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc.). 
- Les support matÃ©riels (catalogue de produits notamment) sont les principaux concurrents de l""agrÃ©gateur.

- Les sites de ventes en ligne du marchÃ© intÃ©rieur. Ces sites sont en gÃ©nÃ©ral spÃ©cialisÃ©s ou associÃ© Ã  une marque particuliÃ¨re. Notre stratÃ©gie est de nous enrichir du contenu de ces sites pour centraliser le trafic et les clients potentiels. 

- Les grand sites gÃ©nÃ©ralistes de vente en ligne (tels que eBay, Amazon) : ces sites ont trÃ¨s peu de pÃ©nÃ©tration dans les pays du Maghreb.",,,,"Nous pensons gÃ©nÃ©rer des revenus par deux moyens: 
1- PublicitÃ© au sein de la plateforme :
Les revenus dÃ©pendent du trafic du site.
Environ 5 utilisateurs sur 1000 cliquent sur un affichage publicitaire. Un clic gÃ©nÃ¨re 0,15 DHs.
Nous estimons pouvoir un revenu publicitaire couvrant la totalitÃ© des coÃ»ts de structure Ã  partir de 2014.
2- Partenariats avec les sites bÃ©nÃ©ficiant du trafic redirigÃ©:
Il s""agit de la principal source de revenus. La facturation sera en fonction du trafic redirigÃ© vers dâ€™autres sites. Des ""partenriats"" seront Ã  mettre en place (modÃ¨le alibaba) pour disposer dâ€™un modÃ¨le gÃ©nÃ©rique de facturation. Nous estimons quâ€™en moyenne, un client redirigÃ© pourra Ãªtre facturÃ© 0,15$..","Lâ€™avantage concurrentiel de notre produit reside dans le fait que nous sommes pionniers sur le marche grÃ¢ce aux facteurs cle de succes de notre agrÃ©gateur qui sont la fiabilite et la securite des transactions, la concentration sur un meme agrÃ©gateur dâ€™une large gamme dâ€™offres de produits de diffÃ©rentes natures, lâ€™ergonomie de la page internet et surtout la rapidite de mise sur le marche et la forte visibilite qui sera acquise sur internet par le biais dâ€™une politique de webmarketing aggressive.

Lâ€™image de marque assise sur ces princinpes qui sera ainsi crÃ©Ã©e sera gage de qualitÃ© et fera toute la difference avec les concurrents indirects sur le marche que peuvent-etre dâ€™autres sites marchands ou agregateurs a offres et visibilite limitees.

Le seul moyen de maintenir lâ€™avantage concurrentiel relatif a cette image de marque est la rapidite de mise sur le marche et la possibilite de profiter rapidement du first mover advantage et de le perenniser par le biais dâ€™une strategie commerciale efficace.

Les nouveaux entrants auront ainsi plus de mal a rattrapper un dÃ©veloppement rapide de notre produit.","Nous estimons avoir besoin de 135 000 $ pour construire disposer d""une plateforme implantÃ©e solidement solide dans le paysage Internet marocain.

Les ressources nÃ©cessaires pour atteindre cet objectif sont les suivantes:
- 3 ingÃ©nieurs pour dÃ©velopper la plateforme et les mÃ©canismes d""intÃ©gration avec les diffÃ©rents sites,
Le coÃ»t d""un ingÃ©nieur de qualitÃ© au Maroc est de 13 000 DHs. Les ingÃ©nieurs ont besoin de 4 mois pour dÃ©velopper une premiÃ¨re version, et de cycle de dÃ©veloppement de 3 mois.
- Un commercial pour construire les diffÃ©rents partenariats et dÃ©velopper l""offre marketing.
Le salaire d""un commercial au Maroc est autour de 10 000 DHs par mois. Un seul commercial sera Ã  recruter 3 mois aprÃ¨s le dÃ©but des premiers dÃ©veloppements.
- 1 Assistant(e) au coÃ»t de 400$ par mois.

CoÃ»ts de location :
- La location d""un bureau estimÃ© Ã  600 $ par mois.
- Entretien et logistique : 200 $ par mois.
- CoÃ»ts administratifs : 170$ par mois.
- CoÃ»ts d""hÃ©bergement (variable en fonction du volume de trafic): 100 $/mois en moyenne sur la premiÃ¨re annÃ©e.

Notre analyse des revenus vs coÃ»ts nous indique que l""Ã©quilibre budgÃ©taire sera atteint aprÃ¨s 18 mois environ. Ce qui nous amÃ¨ne aux coÃ»s suivants :

CoÃ»ts RH : 
IngÃ©nieurs (3) : 3*1300*18 = 70 200
Commerciaux (1) : 1000*15 = 15 000
Assistante : 400 * 18 = 7 200

CoÃ»ts de matÃ©riels :
Hardware : 11 000 $ (incluant rÃ©paration)
Location : 600*18 = 10 800
HÃ©bergement : 100*18= 1800 $
CoÃ»ts de license logiciel : 0$ (gratuit pour start-ups)

CoÃ»ts administratifs : 3000$

Autre coÃ»ts (entretien) : 3600$

Soit un coÃ»t total de 122 000 $. 

Pour gÃ©rer les alÃ©as du cash et le fond de roulement, nous souhaitons majorer cette somme de 2 mois, soit une somme finale de 135 000$.
Dans le cadre de notre levÃ©e de fond, nous avons dÃ©ja des promesses d""investissement Ã  hauteur de 40 000 $. Les fonds de l""Ã©quipe sont de 30 000 $. Nous souhaitons  donc lever des fonds Ã  hauteur de 52 000$.",,"Les PME sont le socle du tissu Ã©conomique. Elles reprÃ©sentent plus de 90% de l""ensemble des entreprises et sont le poumon de l""Ã©conomie.
Un agrÃ©gateur online fournit la possibilitÃ© d""Ã©tendre le marchÃ© d""une PME au delÃ  de sa localisation ou son rÃ©seau de distribution physique, il permet d""avoir un marchÃ© potentiellement limitÃ© Ã  l""ensemble des internautes en capacitÃ© d""acheter.
Il fournit un rÃ©el vecteur de croissance Ã  toutes ces entreprises qui ont des vÃ©ritables avantages conncurrentiels au niveau de leur prix ou qualitÃ© mais ne bÃ©nÃ©ficient pas de la force commerciale nÃ©cessaire Ã  leur expansion.
Nous sommes convaincus que ce projet, au dela de sa dimension Ã©conomique affirmÃ©e, a une dimension sociale qui peut catalyser la croissance (crÃ©ation de nouveaux emplois et contribution Ã  l""augmentation du PNB/habitant notamment).","Gestion de risques :

1- Risque que le trafic soit en dessous des seuil attendus :
Le trafic de la plateforme est le facteur clÃ© de succÃ¨s du projet.
Nous effectuerons plusieurs actions proactives pour mitiger ce risque :
PublicitÃ©,
RÃ©fÃ©rencement pour apparaÃ®tre en tÃªte de liste dans les recherches Google,
IntÃ©gration avec les rÃ©seaux sociaux pour effectuer une campagne de marketing virale,
Ciblage des sites B2C les plus visitÃ©s dans la phase initial.

2- DifficultÃ© Ã  Ã©tablir des contrats commerciaux

Une stratÃ©gie commerciale est Ã  dÃ©finir pour Ã©tablir des partenariats de faÃ§on rapide.
Un focus devra Ãªtre portÃ© Ã  la qualitÃ© des ressources commerciales,
Le pilotage des ressources commerciales ainsi que les mÃ©canismes dâ€™incitation Ã  la performance devront Ãªtre soigneusement affinÃ©es,
Pour mitiger le poids de ce risque, dâ€™autres sources de revenus seront effectifs tels que la publicitÃ© sur le portail dâ€™agrÃ©gation.

3- Nouvel entrant sur le marchÃ©

Actuellement inexploitÃ©, nous estimons que le marchÃ© permet la prÃ©sence de plusieurs acteurs dâ€™agrÃ©gation. Toutefois, ce risque est mitigÃ© par un les actions suivantes :
Lancement rapide du projet et notamment une stratÃ©gie commerciale agressive pour pÃ©nÃ©trer le marchÃ© des partenaires,
Lâ€™intÃ©gration de fonctionnalitÃ©s conÃ§ues pour augmenter le taux de retour des visiteurs du site (fidÃ©lisation).","Le marche cible est l""ensemble des pays au sein de la zone MENA (Middle East and North Africa).
Toutefois pour la premiÃ¨re cible, nous souhaitons de faÃ§on pragmatique nous concentrer sur le Maroc que nous considÃ©rons comme un pilote de lancement qui permettra de valider la plateforme pour la dÃ©ployer sur d""autres pays. A noter que le dÃ©ploiement peut s""effectuer sur plusieurs pÃ©rimÃ¨tres:
1- B2C, qui est notre pÃ©rimÃ¨tre initial permettant de gÃ©nÃ©rer le trafic nÃ©cessaire Ã  l""expansion ciblÃ©e.
2- C2C pour gÃ©rer les Ã©changes entre internautes.
3- B2B, Ã©changes d""entreprises","1- Absence sur le marchÃ© dâ€™un agrÃ©gateur permettant de repondre au consommateur qui cherche Ã  acheter un produit donnÃ© au Maroc et veut obtenir les differentes offres existantes sur le marchÃ©.
2- Les sites internet ecommerce actuels sont essentiellement des sites d""achat groupÃ©s disperses, peu visibles sur les moteurs de recherche et prÃ©sentant une gamme dâ€™offres tres limitee en termes de produits en se concentrant le plus souvent sur les offres promotionnelles
3- MalgrÃ© les moyens de paiement informatiques dont il dispose de plus en plus et son desir de sâ€™informer et dâ€™acheter des biens sur internet le consommateur est limitÃ© par le nombre reduit de produits decrits et proposÃ©s et par le nombre de sites differents et ne dispose pas dâ€™un site regroupant les reponses a tous ses besoins.

Le consommateur doit souvent recourir Ã  des sites internet Ã©trangers pour des propositions et des descriptions de produits de qualite mais il est limitÃ© par le nombre dâ€™achats en devise quâ€™il peut effectuer et ne trouve pas lâ€™equivalent des agrÃ©gateurs Ã©trangers concentrant la rÃ©ponse a tous ses besoins dâ€™achat au Maroc, c""est a ce besoin du marche que nous repondons.",1,NULL,0,0,,,NULL,"Dans le contexte actuel de la zone MENA, nous considÃ©rons le moment propice pour la crÃ©ation dâ€™un agrÃ©gateur. De faÃ§on pragmatique, nous souhaitons cible le Maroc comme premier jalon pour ensuite nous Ã©tendre vers les pays de la zone MENA.

Qu""est ce qu""un agrÃ©gateur :
Une plateforme internet ouverte qui fournit des informations actualisÃ©es sur des produits commercialisÃ©s par dâ€™autres 

fournisseurs (ci-dessous, exemple dâ€™alibaba.com).

Pourquoi un agrÃ©gateur au Maroc, maintenant?

Les indicateurs de lâ€™Ã©volution du marchÃ© Ã©lectronique marocain sont au vert et prÃ©sagent une croissance soutenue et soutenable :

1- Un chiffre dâ€™affaire avec des pourcentages dâ€™Ã©volutions Ã  3 chiffres : Le volume de transaction Ã©lectronique du marchÃ© Ã©lectronique marocain double tous les ans (actuellement de 70 millions de $).


2- Une bancarisation en hausse :
Un accroissement des pratiques monÃ©taires avec lâ€™augmentation du nombre des cartes bancaires en circulation, qui ont 

dÃ©passÃ© le seuil de 6,5 millions de cartes sous les labels Visa, MasterCard et CMI. 
Selon les statistiques du CMI, le volume de transaction bancaire a Ã©tÃ© multipliÃ© par 2,4 % en passant de 277.000 transactions contre 115.000 pour les six premiers mois de lâ€™annÃ©e 2010. 

3- Une augmentation rÃ©guliÃ¨re du nombre de site eCommerce : Le nombre de sites B2C a augmentÃ© de 30% en 2011 et les estimations d""Ã©volutions sont trÃ¨s optimistes pour les annÃ©es Ã  venir.

4- Lâ€™amÃ©lioration de la confiance numÃ©rique comme prioritÃ© nationale :
Des initiatives nationales sont en cours dâ€™exÃ©cution pour amÃ©liorer la confiance numÃ©rique dâ€™ici 2013 (cf. stratÃ©gie nationale pour la sociÃ©tÃ© de lâ€™information et de lâ€™Ã©conomie numÃ©rique): 
- Initiative 1 : Mettre Ã  niveau et renforcer le cadre lÃ©gislatif.
- Initiative 2 : Mettre en place les structures organisationnelles appropriÃ©es.
- Initiative 3 : Promouvoir et sensibiliser les acteurs de la sociÃ©tÃ© Ã  la sÃ©curitÃ© des systÃ¨mes dâ€™information.","Nous avons effectuÃ© une Ã©tude de l""historique de l""evolution du marchÃ© Ã©lectronique dans les pays occidentaux.
De plus, nous avons effectuÃ© un sondage auprÃ¨s de plus de 2000 personnes sur Internet pour connaitre leur appÃ©tence Ã  faire des achats en ligne.
Finalement, nous avons analysÃ© finement l""ensemble des statistiques du marchÃ© Ã©lectronique marocain qui sont concluants par rapport Ã  l""opportunitÃ© (qui nous semble historique).",7

The guest selection of a meal can be based on her/his taste, availability date, the host profile, the place profile, and even shared interests! When the guest confirms a reservation, the host will only extend the planned meal to be enough for his family and for the guest. The guest share of the meal can either be sent to him through a delivery service provider to his location or it can be served in the host place where both (the host and the guest) can meet to have the planned meal and to share a mutual conversation about a topic that interests both of them.

The classical method of showing the data in the forums but obstacles for user to find & obtain the information he needs from other person trip report, user needs to read too many pages with too many unnecessary replies from people who comment, for example you need to read from to 15 to 23 page as an average -for each trip report- to obtain the information you want from one person trip report he shared in the forum !.
however GoEjaza is different ?
GoEjaza platform overcomes these obstacles & make it easy for both ( user who share his trip report & user who want to benefit from this story) to easy share the information about his trip in a new effective way.

2-International review and planning sites like :
(examples: www.igougo.com - www.tripadvisor.com )
Pros:
Organized content & reviews regarding hotels or restaurants or tourism destinations
Cons:
- The content in these websites is in English.
- Majority of users of these websites are not from the region. This obviously appears in lack of Arabic users using these websites & explain large number of visitors & users of Arabic travel forums because it""s the only platform available to Arabic users to share their travel experience.
however Goejaza is different ?
First: we build goejaza.com for people who searches for original travel content by Arabic users having similar culture
Second: also we are not just a website that collect reviews about places like hotels, restaurant""s, ... etc, we go beyond that by offering a tool make you plan your trip online and made bookings for all your trip activities in one place.

3-Booking websites like (http://booking.com, http://www.fendeq.com/):
pros: 
- Provide hotels booking services
- Some websites also provide flight and cars reservations .
Some websites show users review s of hotels from tripadvisor or using simple review system in the hotel information page.
cons:
- no information about travel destination ... show only information about hotels, with minority presence of user reviews.
- No added value for users, except reservation services.
how is GoEjaza different ?
GoEjaza is a complete trip experience start from inspiring user for his next trip to crowdsource information from real traveller experience ending with planning & booking, and these competitors don""t over anything more to the user except the booking & information about hotels.

4-The Tourism Companies :
pros:
Personalized service.
Offers complete Trip packages.
Cons:
-Majority serving the customers through office during time of works. And that need to be visited thought customers.
-Don""t offers Detailed information about hotels like photos and customer reviews.
how is GoEjaza different ?
As the past competitors GoEjaa provide complete Added values services to enrich traveller trip experience. The tourism companies doesn""t provide after sale value or services to the customer.
GoEjaza Help The traveller from the inspiration, bookings of all trip activities and make acceptable from any device. Helping the user by reminding him about his daily plan portable with him from his mobile or tablet or laptop.

Target Customers:
For the first year we will be focused on the niche market of alternative fuel transportation (an estimated 10 million ton market) where we have 10 months of experience and built a strong relationship with suppliers and consumers (cement companies). Our 3-5 years strategy for marketing is:
Small & Medium companies with moderate trucking needs.
Freight forwarders (class A &B ).
Large manufacturers. (Cement/steel/wheat,..).  
",,"KLoad is having the advantages as the first mover offering location based transportation management services in Egypt. This gives us a strong advantage over competitors. 
Direct competition:
4-	 Trucking brokers: KLoad will have the advantage of access to the location information of a big number of trucks. In addition, shippers will have instant online access to KLoad to communicate their trucking needs.
5-	Trucking contractors: Contractors are specialized in on type of tucking service. They will have more flexibility in serving customers with using their owned trucks. Yet, they donâ€™t offer value added service offered by KLoad (such as document management/reporting). In addition, their service is not reliable because of lack of access to a wide range of truck owners. 
6-	Transportation management solutions providers (TMS). KLoad offered as SAAS (software as a service) is much lower in cost and implementation/training time than TMS. In addition, we offer location information about trucks and shipments. 
7-	Large trucking companies. Own less that 3% of trucks. Most of large trucking companies act as freight forwarders and use their fleet to serve their clients. 
Indirect competitors, Freight forwarders: Most of ports freight trucking is done via Freight forwards who offer clearance and door to door transportation to clients. KLoad short term strategy is to offer its service to class A&B freight forwarders where we can keep competitive rates and sell value added service.  
","Linking trucks to available load via KLoad will have a significant impact in the following areas:
1-Reduce final product cost: reducing transportation cost will reflect on final product cost. Cost reduction will make the product more competitive locally and in the international market. 
2- Reduce CO2 emission: Road transport consumes 30% of Egypt subsidized fuel and emits 28 million ton of CO2 per year. Increasing the truck productivity will reduce the amount of emitted CO2 and wasted fuel consumed by empty travelling trucks. 
4-Improve road safety: Trucks cause 40% of road accident in Egypt, a major cause of accidents is poor maintenance specially tires (Flat tires cause 20% of accidents). Increasing the economic productivity of vehicles will help owners (90% of trucks are owned by individuals) to spend on regular truck maintenance
",,"Sustain a development team for 1.5 year (36,000 USD)
Build company website/corporate identity (3,000 USD)
Building marketing/training material (3:000 USD)
","Heavy trucks travel empty for 70-80% of return trips. The low performance of heavy trucks results in higher transportation cost due to the fuel, oil and tires wasted during the empty travel. 
15% of the trucks is Egyptâ€™s 500,000 truck are heavy trucks. The heavy trucking fleet transport 60% of the estimated 450 million ton of freight in Egypt. 
The transportation cost can be lowered by 30% if information about truck location and available loads are available. 
KLoad innovation comes from offering the following:
1- Location based service: Using Cell ID/GPS tracking to link trucks to available loads.
2- On demand TMS: Providing a low cost and easy to use Transportation Management System for small and medium enterprises. 
3- Mobile access: Providing mobile interface to drivers/truck owners to allow easy communication in addition to the desktop interface.

 Other major revenue s source will be selling value added service to corporate using a freemium model. Our target in 5 years is to reach 1000 corporate subscriber with gross revenue of 1 million USD.

","KLoad : connecting trucks to loads 
KLoad is a location based transportation management system (TMS) that connects trucks to available loads. Shipper uses an online company account to place their shipment orders. Using location based technology and available trucks details; KLoad will be able to locate trucks nearest to the shipment and directs the driver through mobile communication to the shipment.   
 KLoad will offer other value added service such as document management, shipment tracking, and history reports, and billing information to clients.

By reducing uncertainty, companies will find it more attractive to hire recent graduates with no professional experience. Our venture will contribute to the employment of the youth.  ",,"The money will go towards web development  and the development of the psychometric test. ","25% of the youth in the Arab world are unemployed. This gets more problematic given that a third of the population in the Arab World is between 15 - 29 years. Youth unemployment is very costly as it hinders the development of Arab countries. The monetary cost of youth unemployment reaches $40 to $50 billion a year. 

There is a huge gap between college students and the private sector. The private sector faces uncertainty when hiring a recent graduate as there is no background experience that they could rely on to reduce the risk associated with their selection. Moreover, college students seeking full-time positions find it very difficult to market themselves and to legitimize their skills and abilities as a great fit. 

What makes the problem more complicated is the application process. College graduates applying to entry-level positions face difficulties finding the applications online and then filling them out. Entry-level applicants usually do not have rich professional experience that supports their credentials, which leaves an undesirable amount of white space in their applications.  

Companies in the Middle East differ in terms of their speed in adopting online job applications. Many companies have an informal application process, which mainly depends on networks. This limits the pool of candidates a company has. It also confines the applicants to a small number of potential employers, which reduces their chances of getting a job offer.

Each applicant will receive a score (similar to a credit score) and companies will have the freedom to decide on which range they are willing to accept. Using psychometrics reduces the risks associated with hiring recent graduates with no professional experience. It also enables companies to identify applicants that fit their companiesâ€™ culture and hence, have a better chance of succeeding at their job.

Naturally Wasla.com will have a lot of competitors as it is a website on the internet that providing same as other competitors a page for a huge database but the only differences from the other competitors is the focusing of the database and the high quality control presented in the network of the website. So here in this section, there is a spot on Wasla.com competitors and what differentiate Wasla.com service from others.
Primary-Direct competitors:
Main competitors are normal search engines (E.g Google, Yahoo, Bing, Msn).
As for Google or other search engines they lack reliability and list the results according to the number of viewers that provide weak image about the business quality, and it list a lot of irrelevant results as well as wasting a lot of time and effort to get specific company through search a massive database with billions of inputs .Beside that if the user is specific with the search keywords still he will have to go through huge results list. Therefore, it didnâ€™t provide reliable results which will decrease the accuracy or the results.
Indirect Competitors:
Websites offering similar services as (Alibaba and Tamkeen) representing the main secondary competitors for Wasla.com. Alibaba and Tamkeen are website that are competing Wasla.com globally.
For Tamkeen is a website that is totally different from Wasla.com network. It is only same as Wasla.com in the point of dealing with the SME""s in Egypt. But Tamkeen have a different way than Wasla.com as dealing with the SME""s in Egypt in a developmental way and also working with them in a detailed staff or help the SME""s from their scratch to their launch.
For Alibaba is a website that includes transactions of buying, selling, and outsourcing. They are contradicting to Wasla.com focus which is a network of integrated, huge database for the benefit of SME""s in Egypt. Ali Baba is a family of Internet-based businesses, which operates the leading global e-commerce platform for small businesses around the world. In June 30, 2012, the platform had 29.4 million registered users from more than 240 countries and regions and showcased 2.5 million supplier storefronts.
Alibaba although it provides kind of similar service, still it lacks a lot of what differentiate Wasla.com service than any other website. As its ranking based on seniority on the website and it donâ€™t guarantee the high quality of companies that recognize our services than any other competitors and furthermore it donâ€™t allow members to review other companies or give their feedback about the transactions it did through the website which hinder their communication with their customers. In addition to that, wasla.com offers much special services for its customers that guarantee the delivering of a unique value for our customers and ensure their loyalty.
Other competitors:
Other competitors could be normal brokers but those brokers have limited network and canâ€™t cover all fields. Plus, they have inaccurate data about the companyâ€™s quality and performance. Furthermore, brokers could have unethical decisions that are avoided by our website.
Competitive position:
No other business in Egypt focuses exclusively on the quality of the information that can be needed by the SME""s in their business field or integrating them in a one website on the internet. This benefit or this competitive advantage can provide the website a high attention getter to it from different levels of companies or sectors in the Egyptian market.
The search engines as Google, Yahoo, and msn that are competing all around the world. But for Wasla.com website after the first 5 years of operation in the market, it will be presented in Cairo but with an easier way to the SME""S around Egypt .Due to that Wasla.com will reach to their specific information in its integrated network for different databases. In addition to that,Wasla.com website will offer a high quality database that integrate different information that are in a need by the SME""S .Then Wasla.com will be expanded in another three countries after the 5 years of operations.
For Wasla.com the different search engines and the other websites in the market for the same purpose of giving the internet users a huge database for different information are shaping a huge competition for Wsal.com in the market .And these competitors also are profitable in the market and successful. But Wasla.com has an integrated network with a competitive advantage over the other competitors, which as it was mentioned the integration and the focusing in different business sectors that will be needed by the SME""s in their business. All these information will be in a one place with a high quality control.",,,"we will start implementing our project and launch the 1st stage on Egypt before expanding.","The opportunity of Wasla arise from understanding the our market as SMEs represent about 80% of the value added business in Egypt with 80% of the total offered jobs in the job market. So this huge market needs services to support its gross and achievements. And as one of the main problems face any SME in Egypt and many other countries is finding trustable committed suppliers and partners especially if they couldnâ€™t access the market of big suppliers due to the high costs or harsh competition with barriers of entry to those suppliers. That was the main reason to think about Wasla.com.",,,,,,,,,,,1,NULL,0,0,,,,"""Wasala .com will try to make spaces closer than it appears, in only one click through one Web from Your personal Laptop.By bringing and integrating different suppliers partners in different sectors for the benefit of the small and medium enterprises in Egypt .That will save time, money and guarantee the quality of the information. BY that it will have the long run impact for a progress to the country""s economic development"".
Wasla.com is a website created for SMEs in Egypt that lack networks and search for good new partner and better offers. Here, you can get trusted connections for rated companies with 100% secured online transactions. Highly experienced Quality management teams will be outsourced to rate the performance of the companies to allow it to be member on our website and legal advisors supervise the performed transactions as well and can review the contracts between parties as third trusted partner.

time when the newly-enrolled students reached 1,200 students this year, ordering food became a 
major issue at AUCâ€™s new campus. Instead of using breaks for extracurricular activities and/or taking a break, as they are was meant to be used, students and faculty find themselves in a race against time to get the food they want and have the time to eat it while doing any other commitments. What seems to be a solution is to avoid ordering food during assembly hours (a break given to the whole AUC community, it is from 1-2 pm everyday) and utilizing the 15-minute breaks between classes, but this never works, because everyone does it. The main reason for this problem is that AUCâ€™s food outlets system was not built to accept such a huge inflow, especially during assembly hours and upon bus arrivals. Not only does this annoy the AUC community, it affects the profits these outlets make as well; we believe that the solution to this is for AUC to have an efficient pre-ordering system. Engezny originated to solve this problem.",,,,,,,,,,,1,NULL,0,0,,,,"Engezny is a food pre-ordering system that allows both customers to order food from any food outlet without being there physically and to pick it up at 
the time they wish. The pre-ordering system allows its users to log in through a website and to order food and also pay for it.
The purpose of the  Engezny  is to save  the  time and effort wasted on waiting to order in the different outlets due to the long waiting lines. In addition, Engezny aspires to enhance the quality of food ordered through having the outlets aware of the orders beforehand and providing them  with enough time and space to schedule preparing the orders rather than rushing them out due to crowded outlets.

As we are student at the American University in Cairo AUC, we attempt to first implement the project on small scope on campus because we already face a problem in food queues in breaks. ",,7

We believe this can be achieved through the building of a healthy competition between universities and when this competition is achieved, the role of The College Experience will be to display this educational heritage to the public. At the same time, we believe that running a business which is caused-based and gives back to society as it grows is a business that will be able to sustain itself in the future.

Reducing traffic accidents would save lives by reducing related fatalities. It would also reduce injuries, which would also reduce medical costs and insurance.  Moreover, it would reduce the $6 billion that Saudi spends each year on traffic accidents management. Another positive economic effect would be that traffic jams would be reducing, because of the reduction I the number of accidents that caused it. Reducing traffic accidents might also help the environment, because of the reduction in number of vehicles being disposed each year. The business would also create high tech well-paid jobs for employees who will work on developing and operating the software. Saving lives, having positive effects on the economy and the environment makes TARS a win-win business for both the investors and the community.",,"To develop and produce the software.","The main problem is traffic accidents. Saudi Arabia has a very high rate of traffic accidents. Moreover, most of the solutions implemented to solve this problem proved to be ineffective. According to Saudiâ€™s Secretary-general of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITC), in 2012 the Saudi government spent $6 billion on the management of traffic accidents, while traffic accidents fatalities increased 10% (Source: Jiffry, F., 2012.

The business is very scalable because it can satisfy this demand with little changes made to the software. Moreover, these changes and tweaks to the software that will make it suitable for other markets are few (mainly maps and interface language). The few changes indicate that there will be an increase in profits without a proportionate increase in costs.",,,"selling the software, subscriptions to the software, and the after sales services.",1,NULL,0,0,,,"The first step was to investigate traffic accidents reduction solutions implemented in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states. The solutions were assessed by comparing the number of traffic accidents, related number of fatalities/injuries in different years. All these numbers had an increasing trend, while the solutions implemented failed constantly. Moreover, most of the solutions were legislations and laws which produced general unconcentrated efforts to deal with the problem.","TARS collects traffic accidents data, analyse it, and help implementing and evaluating its solutions. TARS will have a smart phone app that traffic officers use to report traffic accidents that they handle (Reporting locations, times, number of injuries, and deaths). The smart phone app will crowd source the data collection process creating a huge mine of data for the software to analyse. The software will produce an interactive map with each cluster of accidents represented as a point. The colour of the each point represents the frequency of accidents (red for high, orange for medium, and yellow for low). When clicking on any accidents point a profile will appear, containing the pointâ€™s details. The details include its number, status, and historical data. The employees must suggest a solution to reduce the accidents in this point, using data that the software analysed. After inserting the solution, the software starts tracking the change in the rate of accidents, deaths, and injuries in the point. Solutions can be viewed and sorted depending on district, status, and rate of change. This feature enables the traffic department to identify the employees or teams with best/worst solutions, which can become a field of competition. The software will be able to learn from the users and starts recognising patters, which enables it to start suggesting solutions for accident points, or even modifications for current implemented solutions.",,7

"," â€œTouching Careâ€ is the only social network customized for Alzheimerâ€™s society and developed in English and Arabic and soon in other languages. It provides innovative integrated system with a large variety of useful features to support each of the three main users: caregivers, Alzheimerâ€™s patients and physicians. They all encounter different problems related to the onset of the disease.

â€¢	Caregivers: 
Alzheimerâ€™s disease put caregivers on strenuous and tremendous emotional, social, physical and financial stress. Caregivers lack daily social and emotional support, which leads them to fall into depression and feel helpless. Thus â€œTouching Careâ€ provides caregivers with a window to speak through a feature called â€œLoungeâ€, where they can share their stories and experiences, voice their concerns and seek knowledge and needed support. 
Caregivers undergo tremendous stress and pressure due to the lack of a system or tool that help them organize their day to day activities, develop better coping strategies, reduce their burden and empower them with the knowledge on best practices in dealing with this disease. â€œTouching Careâ€ addresses those needs through â€œCalendar and Medication Plannerâ€ where caregivers can organize in a user-friendly way the entire medical condition of the patient and track daily changes. Caregivers can generate a daily checklist to track the overall health of the patient, which make the life of caregivers easier as it reduce their care giving burden. Many caregivers find it difficult to find the care products needed to provide a good care for the Alzheimerâ€™s patient. â€œTouching Careâ€ solve this pressing issue through â€œAids and Toolsâ€ feature, which aim to provide caregivers with the tools and equipments needed to look after their loved ones.
â€¢	Alzheimerâ€™s patients:
Alzheimer patients suffers because of the lack of Alzheimerâ€™s friendly community specially that unfortunately the community tend usually to stigmatize the person with Alzheimerâ€™s and perceive him/her as someone unconscious, useless, and cannot be engaged in the social activities. This isolation and neglecting consequently increases Alzheimerâ€™s patientâ€™s levels of depression and anxiety, which is proved scientifically to accelerate the onset of their deterioration. Furthermore, Alzheimerâ€™s patients lack the tools that help them to stimulate their memory and cognition. Studies have shown that the patient requires intensive mental stimulation to slow the onset of the disease and level of deterioration. â€œTouching Careâ€ therefore provides â€œReminiscenceâ€ or mental stimulation tools through â€œPhoto Albumâ€ feature, â€œMultimedia Studioâ€ feature, â€œMemory Games â€œ and â€œDiariesâ€ features. 
â€¢	Physicians:
Physicians lack a system that helps them track their patientâ€™s medical condition, capture real-time/dynamic information necessarily to track the patientâ€™s progress and provide accurate diagnosis. â€œTouching Careâ€ therefore empower physicians with the ability to track patient daily medical condition and generate user-friendly graphs for better clarity and visibility.
 Thus, to address the needs of the entire ecosystem: caregivers, Alzheimerâ€™s patients, and physicians. â€œTouching Careâ€ comes to pick up on all these dimensions with its integrated, interactive, enriching features and appealing user experience.

*We are doing that through merging 5 things together:
-Physics
-Practical skills
-Technical knowledge
-Interpersonal skills
-Moral lessons

""The 1st letter of every term are the project name (PPTIM)""

*PPTIM consists of 3 arms:
-B2D
-MILE 
-Robot-Khana

*We are trying to apply this concept through 3 different arms, it is the same idea and concept, but the tool is a little bit different in every project.

>>>1st Arm: (B2D ""Born To Discover""), Target age: 8-12

Aim: Help the kids to be more creative, also to take them out of the digital world and put them in the real and practical one; because the life is not ideal as we see in the PCs. All that through an edutainment way, when merging physics, practical skills, technical knowledge, interpersonal skills and moral lessons in an interesting program.


Cause: We believe that investing in the kids is more important than investing in the adults. They are the future builders. Also, their mind are like a white paper, then, if you succeeded in filling this paper with the write words. You will be able to hope for a better world for them.

Description: It""s a program for the age 8-12 Years. Through this program we give them all the skills mentioned before through building robots. This program is divided into a series of workshops. The kids are divided into teams then they begin their work with the help of the instructors. The instructors give them the knowledge and the skills in a practical way through building their own robots using the CORDian kits.

Tools:
-Kits provided by CORD, it contains materials that we can find around us and we always see daily like: rulers, rubbers, syringes, hoses and much more. The idea is how to merge and connect these materials and make functional robots. These kits are categorized into families and every family into levels. These kits help the instructors through the program. The R&D department in CORD is the responsible department for developing these kits.
-Also the well-trained instructors are the human resource.


>>>2nd Arm: (MILE ""Making Inventors Life Easier""), Target age: 12-16

Aim: As it is shown in the name of the project, making inventors life easier.

Cause: Widening the range of using the CORDian kits to make the largest segment take benefit from the idea.

Description: We consider the kits itself as a separate project; these kits can be sold in the stores, they can be independent with the help of the included manual, which contains the steps you should do to build the robot using the kit. It doesn""t need a course or a program in this case and for that age.

Tools: Only the CORDian Kits.

>>>3rd Arm: (Robot-Khana), Target age: 16-24
""Khana is the pronunciation of a Turkish word means Place""

Aim: Helping the youth to better understand the physics and the technical knowledge they have learned in a practical way. Also developing their creativity, technical skills and interpersonal skills as well. All that to make them be able to take the better decision, be more productive in their lives and change their societies to better ones.

Cause: We also believe in investing in the youth; because they are the builders of the present or the near future.

Description: It""s Robots Competitions that held in different places like colleges, high schools, clubs or any other youth community. The participants take their knowledge from open sessions provided by CORD then they participate to make the competition""s mission. It""s a non-profitable project, as it is also a volunteering activity. It""s like a student to student activity in different communities managed by CORD, we provide an organizational manual that helps the passionate students to start their CORDian branch in their college or school. Step by step from establishing the branch till making the competition through the different phases like: teams registration, competition""s design, book of rules design, open sessions, robots testing, .. etc.

Objective: To make sustainable CORDian branches -Which are volunteering activities, non-profitable and from students to students- in different youth communities all over Egypt, then all over Africa and The Arab World.

Tools:
-The organizational manual provided by CORD which contains all the info. needed by the organizers
-The open sessions provided by CORDian instructors which contains the technical material needed by the participants
-The CORDian kits provided by CORD
-The sponsors that give the fund support to these student activities



*Note: The common thing between the three projects is ""the CORDian Kits"", which is our main tool, it is also in continuous development.

Tarek:
Tarek will manage relationships with partner banks and all creditors. He will also overview the finance of the company in terms of budgeting, risk management and planning. To do that, Tarek will capitilize on his experience and contacts in the banking sector.",,"Borrowers (in Phase 1) will be young men and women between the age of 20 and 35 who would like to pursue a higher education degree both locally and internationally. We estimate those to be around 60,000 (source CAPMAS website). We also estimate the average degree cost to be 10,000 EGP. Assuming an average student would need around 40% of the cost to be financed through a loan then we have a potential loan market of 200,000,000 EGP. Naturally, we would like to start with the high end segmentâ€”degrees from reputable universities both locally and abroad. This strategy should help us to smooth our startup phase with minimal administrative cost, gain quick wins, and establish brand credibility and operational expertise. In later years we would like to cover less costly programs that are needed in the Egyptian job market and even all types of informal education. 
Benefits for borrowers:
-	Banks in Egypt only lend to employees using their salaries as collateral. This makes education loans almost absent in the local market. 
-	Even loans secured from other sources are not tailored for education, i.e. do not include a grace period which the student will not have an income. 
-	Higher chances of employment after graduation
2)	Lenders side:
i.	Partner Bank
o	Chance to experiment with this new product in the Egyptian market
o	Conversational capital in terms of social value created by this business
o	They need us because we will provide relationships with the academic institutes which is critical for this type of product
o	We will also enhance the chances of repayment through matching selected students with career opportunities.
o	Interest earned through a relatively safe loans
o	Potential future clients
ii.	NGOs
o	Opportunity to help more students with less funds
o	Investment in Egyptâ€™s human capital
o	More control over the process
iii.	Regular individuals
Those are regular individuals interested in this type investment
o	A fixed income alternative that pays higher than bank deposits
o	Interest in supporting particular candidates (family, alma mater, co-workers)
iv.	Private Sector
o	Corporate social responsibility
o	Enhanced talent supply

Il existe 8 packs : 

-Pack0 (vitrine en ligne) : Il sâ€™agit de la possibilitÃ© dâ€™afficher ses produits ou services sur sa page avec les informations qui leur sont liÃ©es (photo, prix, quantitÃ© disponible, description, etc). Ce pack permet aux clients de lâ€™organisme de commander online mais ne peuvent payer quâ€™en offline. 

-Pack1 (paiement en ligne): Ce pack donne la possibilitÃ© aux clients dâ€™un organisme de payer en ligne. Si la mise Ã  jour de la quantitÃ© de produits nâ€™est pas automatique, le client doit rÃ©server le produit avant de payer (car il y a possibilitÃ© de rupture de stock avant la mise Ã  jour sur la page du commerÃ§ant). Une fois que le produit est rÃ©servÃ©, le client peut payer.

-Pack2 (CrÃ©ation dâ€™une base de donnÃ©es des produits) : Certains commerÃ§ants nâ€™ont pas de systÃ¨me numÃ©risÃ© de gestion de flux financiers et matÃ©riels. EasyPay peut leur proposer dâ€™en crÃ©er un avec des moyens simples et des prix compÃ©titifs (tablette ou Smartphone, application dÃ©veloppÃ©e ad hoc, systÃ¨me de gestion et dâ€™Ã©tiquetage des produits Ã  base de code QR)

-Pack3 (IntÃ©gration de la base de donnÃ©es des produits) : Si le commerÃ§ant utilise dÃ©jÃ  un systÃ¨me de gestion de stock avec une base de donnÃ©es des produits, il est possible de la connecter Ã  la page du commerÃ§ant. Ainsi, la disponibilitÃ© et le nombre de produits seront mis Ã  jour automatiquement.

-Pack4 (Assistance technique/graphique) : Si le commerÃ§ant nâ€™a pas les photos de ses produits, EasyPay peut lui proposer de faire appel Ã  une Ã©quipe de photographes qui lâ€™aideront Ã  produire des photos de qualitÃ© Ã  mettre sur sa vitrine en ligne. Elle peut aussi lui proposer une formation technique pour la crÃ©ation et la gestion de sa vitrine.

-Pack5 (Flux dâ€™informations) : Le commerÃ§ant peut choisir dâ€™envoyer un flux dâ€™informations sur lequel pourront sâ€™abonner les clients intÃ©ressÃ©s par ses produits. Ainsi, les clients seront informÃ©s des nouveautÃ©s dÃ¨s la mise Ã  jour de la vitrine sans avoir Ã  la consulter.

-Pack6 (Livraison) : Lorsquâ€™un commerÃ§ant vend un produit, EasyPay peut lui proposer de rÃ©cupÃ©rer la marchandise et de la livrer Ã  lâ€™adresse de livraison choisie par lâ€™acheteur.

-Pack7 (Paiement par carte bancaire) : Si le commerÃ§ant le souhaite, EasyPay peut lâ€™aider Ã  intÃ©grer une solution de paiement par carte bancaire en utilisant un terminal de paiement sur Smartphone ou tablette. ",1,NULL,0,0,,,"Ã‰tude rÃ©alisÃ©e par le ministÃ¨re du commerce tunisien.

EnquÃªte auprÃ¨s des organismes pour mieux connaitre leurs besoins spÃ©cifiques.","EasyPay est une sociÃ©tÃ© de service pour les organismes qui projettent de se lancer dans le e-commerce ou qui ont besoin dâ€™offrir Ã  leurs clients la possibilitÃ© de payer en ligne. Ces organismes peuvent Ãªtre des commerÃ§ants, des associations, des prestataires de services, des universitÃ©s privÃ©es, des centres de formations, des organisateurs dâ€™Ã©vÃ¨nements, etc. 

La plus grande valeur ajoutÃ©e de lâ€™entreprise EasyPay sera le site web www.easypay.tn. Câ€™est un site sur lequel tout organisme pourra ouvrir un compte et crÃ©er une vitrine en ligne dans laquelle il proposera ses produits et/ou services. Les clients de cet organisme iront se connecter sur ce site et ils auront la possibilitÃ© dâ€™acheter le produit en ligne. La transaction se fera sur une plateforme unique commune Ã  tous les organismes. Lâ€™argent sera donc versÃ© sur le compte bancaire dâ€™EasyPay et cette derniÃ¨re le transmettra Ã  qui de droit.

Lorsquâ€™un acheteur est intÃ©ressÃ© par un produit, deux cas sont possibles : 
Cas1. Le produit est disponible immÃ©diatement. Dans ce cas,  lâ€™acheteur peut directement cliquer sur Â« Payer Â». Si le vendeur veut mettre en ligne des produits qui sont disponibles immÃ©diatement, il doit sâ€™engage Ã  les livrer quand le client paie.
Cas2. Le produit doit Ãªtre commandÃ© avant dâ€™Ãªtre payÃ© en ligne. Dans ce cas, la procÃ©dure est la suivante : 
- lâ€™acheteur clique sur le bouton Â« Commander Â»
- le vendeur est notifiÃ© quâ€™un client a commandÃ© le produit. 
- le vendeur clique sur Â«Jâ€™accepte la commandeÂ» ou Â«Je refuse la commandeÂ»
- Si le vendeur accepte la commande, lâ€™acheteur peut payer et le vendeur a lâ€™obligation de livrer.

Par ailleurs, EasyPay permettra de rassurer les acheteurs et les vendeurs Ã  distance. En gÃ©nÃ©ral,  les acheteurs ne veulent pas payer Ã  distance avant de recevoir le produit parce quâ€™ils nâ€™ont aucune garantie que le vendeur va le livrer. Les vendeurs, quant Ã  eux, ne veulent pas livrer avant dâ€™Ãªtre payÃ©s parce quâ€™ils nâ€™ont aucune garantie que lâ€™acheteur paiera. Il y a donc besoin dâ€™un tiers de confiance. Le principe d""utilisation du tiers de confiance est le suivant :

1. L""acheteur envoie son paiement Ã  EasyPay et reÃ§oit un code secret
2. Le vendeur expÃ©die le produit Ã  l""acheteur
3. EasyPay est informÃ© de la rÃ©ception du produit par la saisie du code secret (cette saisie est faite soit par l""acheteur soit par le vendeur)
4. Le paiement est alors versÃ© au vendeur",,"Service / E-commerce"

The idea of this project came from the need to healthy individuals to have a guide that helps them find out the exact need of their bodies from calories each day, and not only that, because many available programs can do so. This program is going to suggest a meal plan that matches the amount of calories calculated for each person. 
The program will also tell the user if they are in the range of healthy weight, underweight, overweight or obese phase; according to that the program will either increase the amount of calories needed (if underweight) or decrease the amount of calories needed (if overweight) to facilitate further weight loss, and encourage reaching a healthier weight. All of the calculations in the program are based on scientific equations, and are approved by the World Health organization (WHO).
The program is going to ask the user to provide weight, height, gender, age and physical activity level. According to the numbers given, some calculations are going to be done, and the program will provide the user with the amount of calories that needs to be consumed per day, number of servings from each food group and will also suggest some meal plans.",,7

I have 13 years of experience in software development, including development, architecting and management experience. I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from LAU (Lebanese American University) 

I think that my most valuable skills are my ability to quickly grasp and assimilate any new technology and the ability to tackle any problem and solve it. The latest problem that showcases these 2 abilities was to devise a DDoS defense mechanism for an online poker room and enabled it to fend off massive attacks of 3Gb/s. I also worked on improving the shuffler for that poker room.

Technically, what I bring to the game is a considerable architecting and development experience plus machine learning and AI experience. I love machine learning and AI and I am a firm believer that these disciplines will be a major force in the next evolution of the web. ",,"Bank and big retailers in the MENA area.",,"We are not aware of any company in the market providing such a service. ","If the project is successful we think that it will generate around 15 to 20 jobs. Jobs that includes software developers, customer support, sales and project managers.",,"These are estimates and per year. 

Office Rent + Lawyer Fees + Accountant Fees + Electricity + Internet = 25K

3 Senior Software Developers = 90K

We need at least 3 years of funding for this project to have a chance of survival. 
115K per year x 3 = 345K

During the first year we will find and implement the first solution for the first client. During the second year we should be able to get more clients and by the 3rd we should be able to generate income to support the operations of the startup. After the third we should reach a point where the generated income should attract more investors and will allow to grow the startup to a full fledged company. 

","Let give examples instead. These examples are extracted from a special report by The Economist on big data (Data, data everywhere - Feb 27, 2010)
* In 2004 WalMart peered into its mammoth databases and noticed  that  before  a  hurricane  struck, there was a run on Â‡fashlights and batteries,  as might be expected; but also on PopTarts, a sugary American breakfast snack.

* Best Buy, a retailer, found that 7% of its customers accounted for 43% of its sales, so it reorganised its stores to concentrate on those customersâ€™ needs.  

*Airline yield management improved because analytical techniques uncovered the best predictor that a passenger would actually catch a flÂ‡ight he had booked: that he had ordered a vegetarian meal.

It is these kinds of insights that we want to provide to banks and big retailers.
","Not available.",,,,,,"This is how we envision it. At first we will build custom made solutions then we plan to use the expertise collected to create a generic data solution available online that allows the SME to have the same power of insight as the big companies. 
Imagine for a second a big town retailer in Lebanon who just wants to understand how to increase his sales. He can simply connect his data our service and use it to provide him the insights we got from other retailers. In other words we have repackaged and sold him the intelligence of the big retailer. One such insight might be that he has a large demand for a certain product and we know from other retailers that that product goes very well with another product he does not have in his shop.

So we think we should be able to grow from simple software service provider to a region wide software as a service provider where our client will use our online service instead of our on site expertise. ",,0$,"Banks and big retailers in the MENA area but we don""t have any statistic on the size of that market.",1,NULL,0,0,,,"We are planning to experiment with 2 business models:
Make money out of the profit or savings we are generating for our clients. The service will be offered for free and we only want a portion of the saving or profit the client will be making. This approach gives a better chance to keep the ownership of the insights we will be finding.

Sell the solution as standalone software solution.","The first idea of this startup was to use Machine Learning and AI in order attack the information overload problem. The result was an app called the Morning Book (for more info go to http://www.themorningbook.com) but we were never able to get any traction with this first product so we thought that our best approach is to pivot and apply the things we learned to business data instead. 

Our aim for this new product is to combine artificial intelligence, statistics and art to transform reams of financial and economic data into gripping stories. In short we want the data to tell its story.

This product is not yet built but we have proof through the MorningBook app that we are able to transform a raging river of information that is Twitter into a docile stream. To achieve that goal we needed a way to make the computer â€œunderstandâ€ so that it can filter and sort. Understand that in some contexts ""Apple"" means the computer company not the fruit. Understand that in some contexts â€œsickâ€ might denote a positive sentiment. Neur0s was able to create an algorithm that allows computers to ""understand"". This algorithm is based on a mathematical way that allows computers to work with an intuitive, generalized idea of similarity.

Through our experience in the MorningBook we were able to amass a lot of know-how on converting data into meaningful stories and we want the chance to apply these techniques and technologies to data warehouses of banks and of retail stores.  

At first we will build custom made solutions then we will use this expertise to abstract away as much of the technical complexity as possible and create a product that will put the power of big data into the hands of any business user.","Cultural: We fear the banks will not let us read and process their data however we hope the big retailer are less protective of that data. 

Reputation: Being a startup does not project an image of stability and confidence so we fear future clients will be hesitant to commit.

An avid reader and writer. She believes that team-work is a paramount asset to get any task done, and has an attractive personality that combines unpretentiousness and seriousness at the same time, making her both an excellent manager for her organizing team and an editor constantly providing tips to her reporting team.

Omar El Deeb: Partnerships and fundraising
His experience as a former Student Union president provided him with skills in convincing others and negotiating agreements.

Kariem El Deberky: Partnerships and public relations
An enthusiastic management student whose presentable conversations and good negotiation skills have secured so far a good number of partnership agreements with student societies at AUC, helping us to widely grow their in only 3 months.

Shaheer Shaheen: Project head and editor-in-chief
With an experience of two years as entertainment journalist, and one and half years as the editor-in-chief of the first independent student media entity at GUC, his earned leading skills, connections with students and staff from different universities in Egypt and vision for this project are essential.",,"Higher education students, faculty and staff in Egypt, then the Arab world.",," El Watan newspaper has a section called ""El Watan Universities"" but it mainly deals with controversial (to them, news worthy) stuff. Our idea is not publishing news that would only appeal to the public, but rather mainly targets the students in a specific university, a much more bigger range of news reporting. e.g. at our GUC branch, we share condolences when a student dies.

- In AUC, there are 3 student publications currently active, Caravan, AUC Times and The Advocate. Caravan is a course at AUC, making their work much limited and in general lacks a lot of enthusiasm. The Times is a magazine, different set of content. Advocate is very poor in quality of design and content.

- In BUE, MIU, MSA and 6th of October there are no student newspapers. There have been quite few attempts to establish ones, but all have not continued.

- In state universities, there are a number of competitors, like Radio Mubasher in the engineering school of Cairo University.

Indirect competitors are the daily newspapers and mainstream media that provide coverage mainly when controversial things happen in universities (protests, violence,..)","-Interaction and exchange of ideas between students from different universities and majors.

- Providing a credible news source and preventing circulation of rumors

- Raising cultural knowledge and awareness

- Upholding essential community values: the hard worker and successful get to be portrayed in the media.

- Students learn to formulate opinions of their own to express themselves, as well as debate them sometimes.",,"- Start a recruitment campaign (we make interviews and written exams) to form teams in 6 more universities (beside GUC & AUC that we already have): MIU, BUE, MSA, CIC, FUE, UFE - (estimated total number of students is 60 thousand) by deploying booths in every campus and online advertising  and announce the launch of EgyInsider project (the umbrella under which all local teams are part of). ($2500)

- Make an opening ceremony in every university to officially mark the start of work, and for the team members to meet their team mates and be oriented on how we work. A ""Welcome Pack"" will be given to every member (containing INSIDER notepad, t-shirt with INSIDER logo, INSIDER mug,..). We would also invite prominent public figures from the press and media industries to give speeches. ($600 for each university x 6 universities = $3600).

- Release of the print edition of every university. Each university edition is primarily different from the other university""s, but contains some incorporated content as well.
(30 thousand copies of high quality 80gm white paper: $8,000 per issue. This secured seed-fund will help us quickly publish our early editions (2 or 3) until we make year-long agreements with sponsors. So it""s $24,000).

- Start workshops for our editorial team and organizing committee members. The editorial team would need training sessions by professional journalists, whereas OC members will need soft skills. All these things help raise the caliber of our team and their loyalty to the entity. ($200 per university x 6 = $1200 including with basic catering).

- Save the rest of the money in our bank account to the next year in the same process for more universities (mainly state universities like Cairo University, Ain Shams, Helwan & Azhar).","- Exchange of information, ideas and culture between students.

- Uniting and empowering students by interacting with the community to make a difference.

- Providing access for verified information regarding universities to the students of the Arab world as soon as they happen.",,,,,,,"Currently we are at GUC (German University in Cairo) and AUC (American University in Cairo). We aim at establishing a local team at every university in Egypt by 2014, then the Arab world.

All these local teams are part of The Egyptian Insider project which would be the mother entity making quality assurance reports and making sure all local entities are up to the standards and abiding the rules.

This is one of our issues released at GUC: http://www.gucinsider.com/partnership/issue

- It""s important to highlight the role of our idea in being a media entity, that does journalism as well. We pay a lot of attention to our presence social media and the videos we produce and put on YouTube, giving our readers/audience the choice to follow our work in various formats.

We have had ABB, the multinational electricity and energy company, as our sponsor to fund our work for the past year.

It""s worth mentioning that all team members (current and future) do not get payed for their work, as it is considered a student activity that they volunteer for to gain experience, as commonly practiced.

Also, the project success means being able to reach 2.4 million youth students in Egypt who are the driving force of almost every business and service on the market.",1,NULL,0,0,,,"Generally, we made a study to gather important related facts, like the number of higher education students in Egypt being  estimated at 2.4 million, the number of universities and how many are state/privately owned, the events/occasions where students interact and meet.

In particular, at GUC and AUC we a survey to know how much is the students"" interest in knowing about current events and what topics matter to them most. We perform this survey - with some enhancements - every academic year.","Establishing the first and sole independent media company (newspaper + digital media) dedicated for and run by higher education students from Egypt and the Arab world.",,2

This diverse background sets us apart from our competitors who tend to be device/component oriented lacking IC and overall system know-how. ","The broader impact/commercial potentials of this project are 1) the potential replacement of millions of short-reach and metro 10Gbps ports -already deployed worldwide- by bandwidth-efficient 100G transceivers, and 2) enabling green-field deployment of 100G ports over newly installed fiber.

","The goal of our project is the development of a noncoherent solution, implemented as a system-on-chip ASIC, for 100 Gigabit Ethernet (100G) fiber
optic communications. Internet traffic is expected to grow at a 34% CAGR between 2009 and 2014. Traffic growth is projected to exceed available network capacity in the near future, forcing network operators to deploy new solutions. The solution has to be low-cost, bandwidth-efficient, and compatible with existing optical networks infrastructure. This proposal makes it possible to develop a 100Gbps mixed-signal system-on-chip that will serve as key component within a cost-efficient noncoherent direct detection 100G fiber optic transceiver. The system-on-chip consists of fast data converters (ADCs &DACs), RF modulators/demodulators, tunable filters, variable-gain amplifiers, drivers, and a sophisticated signal-processing digital core. Its functions are 1) pre-process electrical signals prior to their transmission over the optical fiber, 2) process optically received signals to remove fiber distortions (such as chromatic & polarization-mode dispersion, nonlinear impairments) and recover the transmitted data. In contrast to competing coherent solutions which require a multitude of optical drivers, modulators, photodetectors, and coherent-optics components, the proposed solution uses novel techniques which only require a single modulator/driver and a single photodetector.
",,,,,,,"According to Infonetics Research, optical transceiver market is expected to grow to $2.14 billion by 2014 with 40G/100G ports taking on a significant share. Moreover, per ATTâ€™s own prediction, â€œâ€¦every 10G lambda installed today will be a 100G lambdaâ€¦â€ (source: IDC June 2009). Forecasts such as these from industry pundits, system vendors and operators alike indicate that 100G deployment is both imminent and massive. Menaraâ€™s solution combines state-of-the-art DSP and RF techniques requiring fewer optical/electrical components as compared with competing coherent solutions. It thus allows for a compact 100G solution that is cost and power efficient (fewer components needed) and enables service providers to simplify their networks and reduce their cost-per-bit while increasing their port density.",,"$15 million","We have customers in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia.

 Our mission is to help corporate organizations get the qualified calibers they look for and to inspire new graduates to uncover their hidden talents and spread their wings to fly high in the sky and soar like eagles.

-	A court terme le projet permettra dâ€™atteindre le marchÃ© cible de tout le territoire AlgÃ©rien,  Ã  moyen terme le monde arabe et Ã  long terme lâ€™international.
-	Des changements importants seront attendus par le groupe cible(ou le genre de client), qui sont les personnes handicapÃ©es  en retrouvant confiance en eux-mÃªmes et sortant d""une marginalisation imposÃ©e . les associations et  les ONG ,  par le partage d""informations et le retour d""expÃ©riences , les partenaires financiers et sponsors par le biais d""une bonne publicitÃ© pourront Ãªtre des relais  pour atteindre lâ€™objectif dâ€™une communication Ã  lâ€™international
-	Le projet doit gÃ©nÃ©rer diffÃ©rents produits et services pour atteindre les objectifs spÃ©cifiques fixÃ©s ci-dessus : un site internet avec Forum, un magazine traitant le monde de lâ€™handicap.

-	Tenter dâ€™abolir  la nÃ©gligence et l""indiffÃ©rence que subissent les personnes handicapÃ©es,  
-	Mettre la lumiÃ¨re sur leurs compÃ©tences et leurs  qualitÃ©s,
-	CrÃ©er un espace dâ€™information, de sensibilisation et de communication dans le domaine du handicap,

-	Favoriser leur dÃ©veloppement socio professionnel, 
-	Faire Parvenir toutes informations aux personnes handicapÃ©es ne pouvant se dÃ©placer et faciliter le contact entre eux,
-	RÃ©pondre Ã  leurs prÃ©occupations en mettant Ã  leur disposition des spÃ©cialistes dans les diffÃ©rents domaines du handicap en invitant Ã  chaque fois une personne compÃ©tente suivant leurs demandes (mÃ©decin, kinÃ©sithÃ©rapeute, chargÃ© de la scolaritÃ©, â€¦etc.),

We could use GPS enhancement for getting accurate location such as Indoor Positioning System. This application will define and describe these buildings from inside using GPS and GIS technology, and could advertise and market products of these buildings inside the application. These buildings do not have interactive maps that show a very detailed information inside the building. For example, the malls inside KSA only has a very simple maps located inside the maps and give simple information about the shops and does not direct the customer to the shop easily and he must suffer before he could find the shop especially in big malls. I propose a smart phones application that create an interactive map that provide the user with the exact location of the shops inside the malls and give detailed information about every shop such as shop name, shop number, shop opening and closing time, and shop activity, etc... In addition, this application can provide the user with the shop products prices and newest products and indicate if there is a sale on the shop.
The objective of this idea is to save the time of the users inside malls, find the shops easily, and provide them with a very useful information about mallâ€™s shops. In addition, the owner of the shops can market their products inside the application.

And actually there is no permanent drop zone in Lebanon. So there is totally the need to create one.","The idea is to create a Skydiving Center in Lebanon. 
The center will offer all the activities that worldwide skydiving centers offer: tandem jumps, formation to become a solo jumper and secure conditions for solo jumpers to train. In addition, the club will aim at creating a national Lebanese skydiving team to represent Lebanon in worldwide competitions.

Radar and Antenna Basics..Network basics",,"We believe that we have a born global product which will have no geographical barriers. As we mentioned above, we address the market of Aerial geophysical surveying services, NAICS 541360/ SIC 8713. Our first targeted customers are Petroleum & Gas companies for both pipe line as an asset management tool and geological investigation for oil falls, and other governmental bodies including (Ministries of Tourism, Agriculture, and Industry) will be interested in our technologies and services. As we are geographically located in Egypt, we will start by our local market then followed by regional market including North Africa, Gulf Council Countries and the rest of the African content. Then we will go to Europe and the rest of the world.
As mentioned above the GPR air vehicle has a variety of applications and use models in different sectors, solving different client needs with the same technology and application. Regarding only one segment, we have decided to illustrate the details of one of the target markets which, we believe, has high demand especially in Egypt and other African countries. This market is the landmine detection",,"The detector market is likely to be dominated by the metal detector in the short term as it is widely used, its strengths and limitations are well understood, and deminer Standard Operating Procedures and standards are adapted to its use. The market will become more fragmented by the introduction of new technology products, like ours, which meet the differing requirements and expectations of users in different countries.

So, speaking about competitors in EGYPT, there will be the metal detector providers who provide the government with it. those are our main competitors as we are presenting a new technology with a cost effective ""switching cost"".

Our indirect ones are the suppliers. As for our technology, we deal with a few numbers of suppliers.","Safety for deminers!

. We are able to provide our customers with the same final quality they target in a completely safe, fast and reliable solution. With our system, customers can survey/investigate areas they have never been able to reach, thus accomplish tasks that have been impossible to be accomplished before in a timeframe which is not comparable with the traditional alternative solutions. It""s a safe way that protects operators involved in demining activities.  Hitting a buried mine leads to serious injury or even loss of life. The value of investing in GPR technology can easily be realized by eliminating the human element. Putting aside the cost of demining and loss of service, what value can be compared against a human life?!",,"It""ll be the first investment for our Market Product.","Regarding market, our product can address a couple of discovery, mapping and surveying segments, that each serve specific fields. We address Aerial geophysical surveying services, NAICS 541360/ SIC 8713. The mix of convenience, safety and accuracy does not exist inside this segment. Existing solutions involve human resources, thus exposing their lives to danger, or system to malfunction due to rough/ unleveled ground.
In order to show market pain, we will address the landmine detection segment. Contamination by landmines and all other types of unexploded ammunition usually called unexploded ordnance or UXO) is a worldwide problem with enormous humanitarian impact. At least 67 countries are being affected by land mines, but reliable estimates of the area affected worldwide are not readily available. Estimates of the number of mines laid vary widely, from 50 to 150 million. In the mid-1990s, humanitarian demining became a hot topic on the political agenda According to the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling Production and Transfer or Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction (often referred to as the Ottawa Treaty), which entered into force in 1999, all stockpiles of mines should be destroyed within 4 years and all minefields lifted in 10 years.
In addition to antipersonnel mines, sub-munitions such as bomb-lets delivered by air or artillery, multipurpose weapons, and unexploded ordnance should be regarded as mines. These sub-munitions are often more difficult to identify and clear than mines.
""Every 5000 mines cleared one worker will be killed and two workers will be injured by accidental explosions."" Nicolas E. Walsh and Wendy S. Walsh in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization 2003: Using the other common techniques will put 22000 deminer to death and 44000 will be injured besides the additional effects of the antipersonnel mines and the UXO (unexploded ordnance). Autonomous unmanned aerial system becomes a must, as robots become ineffective due to exposure to explosion.
In Egypt, all of our existing problems can be easily tracked to the wasted vast lands that nearly all are expected landmines areas! This was the real motive behind our product at the very beginning; to free Egypt of landmines.
â€œAll existing solutions expose my men to a certain degree of danger.â€ said General Taher Harby, head of engineers division in the Egyptian military, when we first told him about the vision to make our product. â€œIt would be very useful if we could have this ability to make such an accurate and safe detection process.â€ he concluded.
",,,,,,,"There are 120 million mines all over the world. Those create multiple markets as military or private contractors. The areas most affected by land mines include: Egypt (23 million, mostly in border regions); Angola (9-15 million); Iran (16 million); Afghanistan (about 10 million); Iraq (10 million); China (10 million); Cambodia (up to 10 million); Croatia (2 million); Somalia (up to 2 million in the North); Eritrea (1 million); and Sudan (1 million). The ability to enter advanced new products into the detector market will be significantly affected by the price elasticity of the market. Higher priced products at similar market volumes (inelastic market) are more likely if the potential benefits of using the new equipment are significant. A product which could improve the false alarm rate of current metal detectors by a factor of 10 could potentially double the overall clearance rate, resulting in savings of the order of $280k or more per square km. A proportion of such savings could be allocated to increased equipment costs during project budgeting.
The detector market is likely to be dominated by the metal detector in the short term as it is widely used, its strengths and limitations are well understood, and deminer Standard Operating Procedures and standards are adapted to its use. The market will become more fragmented by the introduction of new technology products, like ours, which meet the differing requirements and expectations of users in different countries.We can be The First Mover in alot of countries!.
",,,"We were able to develop our new GPR architecture and air vehicle in a fully integrated functional device with around 12% cost of the cheapest traditional GPR device found in the market. So our new architecture is not just accurate, efficient and effective, it is also economic.

The cost of Removing a mine without knowing its location is 1000$ While the cost while knowing its location is about 30$.!!

In Egypt, For example There are 4.8 billion barrels of oil that cant be accessed because of landmines! Also, there are 13.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas!",1,NULL,0,0,,,"We""ve already marketed the project on Tv and Newspaper and the normal citizen can easily be familiar with our project as we were on alot of popular Tv shows in EGYPT.","A detection device that is highly sophisticated yet simple to operate. A system that is not held in hand, but is operated wirelessly. A seamless scan due to an air vehicle that you need not to worry about. A safe process with no earth or human contact. A map with all key objects (mines, cracks, rocksâ€¦etc.) is finally shown.

The product is based on an innovative radar technology â€”that is Ground penetrating Radar (GPR). It is a geophysical method that uses radar waves to image the subsurface. This method detects the reflected signals from subsurface structures.

Ground-penetrating radar antennas are generally in contact with the ground for the strongest signal strength. For use above the ground, GPR air launched antennas can be used. However, those systems were very large and heavy to the extent they were either fixed in location or installed on a van (bumper level). This rendered the whole process as difficult, very costly and thus impractical. Our product offers the end to the misery through a revolutionary invented architecture. We""ve designed the GPR module to be in no contact with the scanned surface unlike the typical GPR used now. The whole GPR technology is reinvented to over 

the land surface usage through mounting the GPR over an air vehicle providing safety and speed of scan.

But how will we do that ?!

 

We will manufacture a 100% automated bakery machine that will do the whole process of baking. We will put flour in it and wait for loaves at the other side.

 

We will make a 24/7 internet connection between the machine and the ministry of supply. The machine will record the amount of raw flour inside it and number of loaves produced. These recorded data will be sent to the ministry of supply daily. That will ensure an excellent supervision from the ministry of supply on the baker.

 

We will make the whole process automated. The machine will produce bread with its standards specifications which ensures best quality. That will save a lot of wasted raw materials in the manual industry.

 

We will make a database inside the machine which will have the data of the citizens in the neighborhood. That will help to let everyone get the deserved number of loaves daily, no more no less.

 

By making this machine, we are introducing a new way to solve one of the major crises prevailed in Egypt so far. We seek to have a national project which will help the people who suffered too much.

 

Not only that, we are seeking to develop our project in the future. We will add a renewable-energy source to make the machine work with its best efficiency.

 

Making the subsidized bread industry in Egypt 100% automated is not easy, but we dream to see â€œMade in Egyptâ€ on an Egyptian product. It will be our main motivation in this project.

I will be the Chief Enlightenment Officer, overlooking company strategy, financials, accounting. i am skilled at public speaking and creating marketing campaigns. i am also skilled at creating relationships with key partners for the business. 

i have completed my Bachelor""s degree in Business Administration (Concentrations in Marketing and Management) from the American University of Sharjah. i was on the Chancellor""s List (GPA above 3.5) in my final year in the business school, which included my major marketing and management courses.

My last work experience has been at Namshi.com in the Offline Marketing team, where i have learned a lot about what to do and not to do to create a successful online startup. My responsibilities consisted mainly of creating partnerships with key companies and carrying out the campaigns that would create awareness about the brand and generate sales.

Previous to that i worked at the international management consulting firm Oliver Wyman as a Case Team Assistant (CTA) and before that i worked as a Marketing Intern at Zain (Bahrain) and as a Research Analyst at Delta Partners. 


Yasir El Nimr - Nawwer CMO
Known to be self-driven, to the point, and having a bird""s-eye view on most topics, I have graduated from the American University of Sharjah in 2010 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering. Last year, I have started my MBA as a part-time student at the University of Wollongong Dubai.

This week, I have quieted my job at GBM (IBM GMSR) as the Software Support Specialist to dedicate myself to Nawwer. At which I have managed a pipeline of software support renewal contracts worth $6M (2012) for top tier customers in 6 branches. Despite my quota of $4M, I have managed to surpass it by more than 50%. Additionally, my achievements are merely double the sales of year 2011. Being the contact point between IBM TSS team, and GBM ITS branch managers and account managers have made me attain management, negotiation, and problem solving skills.

During my university life, I was an adrenaline pumping student. Being a board member at the Computer club, I was responsible for media and public relations in organizing our trips, seminars, and competitions. Bringing in speakers from blue chip companies such as Microsoft and Nvidia was one of our successes. I have interned at the DIFC as a web designer and mentored at GBMâ€™s networking department. Additionally, I have freelanced as a graphic designer for Interactive Group to design posters, banners and invitations for a corporate event. 

As the Chief Marketing Officer at Nawwer, I will be responsible for the online/offline marketing. I will build on my design, PR, and marketing skills to attain website hits, build partnerships, and achieve customer satisfaction. 


Munzir Suliman - Nawwer CTO
I Grew up watching computers and other electronic parts scattered all over the house, raised in an environment where ""possible"" was up to the effort i put to what i want to achieve.

I always believed that everything in life, including science consists of symbols that identify and rule the laws to govern them. Thus i managed to teach myself MS Office and basic electronics and computer maintenance at the age of 13 and through such definition i gained most of what i know today . 

I don""t believe in titles where a person defines the knowledge he or she claims to have in mind based on some un-passionate compulsory readings. I believe in practices, passion, experiences and efforts to foster creativity and innovation in order to move forward. I have worked as a call center agent in a marketing research company known as TNS where I""ve acquired the required knowledge to move to BRIDGESTONE alserkal as a call center agent and there i got promoted in less than 5 months to become a shop manager and to be selected as the best in the year 2009. During that job I""ve managed to not only meet monthly sales targets, but also to influence technicians to become shop in-charges then shop managers. i""ve taken night classes to obtain an advanced diploma in marketing from a branch based in Dubai of an Australian college named Cambridge Collage International. i have also obtained a statement of accomplishment in databases through an online course offered by Stanford University USA.

I""ve managed to establish relations with Sharjah""s airport free zone through a marketing campaign conducted with a declared purpose of raising awareness for safety while the undeclared reason was to promote the company""s services. This plan has been replicated and reused with Sharjah""s government as well, as a result of the success with the first campaign. In the early days of 2010 got Rewarded with a promotion to join the marketing department as a Retail Marketing Executive. Seeking a better future i started working as a freelancer developing websites ""mainly"" in my brother""s company DOXYTERAA digital solutions and ever since i have been working as a freelancer looking to find the right cause that would make a difference, something that i would wake up every day happily to work on. This have been found in NAWWER.

In addition, we are winners of the 4th place in Startup Weekend Dubai 2012 with a cash money of Dh10,000.

The $50,000 will be well spent on our pilot and expansion stages. Online/offline marketing, university/school visits, graphic designing, and social media are some of the considered spending schemes.

We are looking forward to continue our progress as we are all fully dedicated to our startup to make things happen.","When students are about to graduate from high school, many of them find themselves lost and confused. They have to make critical life-changing decisions, as they are conflicted with so many different choices of universities and majors. 

Not only that, they have to face pressure from their parents, friends, and communities when deciding what the best options for them are; and most of the time they don""t even have the slightest clue, which makes the experience even more distressing!

People at later stages in life face a similar dilemma when going into post graduate studies.

Universities also face issues when it comes to students applying to them. They find it difficult to recruit the right caliber of students to their programs. When students join, there is a high dropout rate among students not enrolled in the optimal field of choice. Also, the application process in most universities is paper-based and rigid, hence utilizing human, time, and capital resources in an ineffective and inefficient way.

And our customers will include all online users, and all companies interested in online marketing with an added value on health awareness.",,"Actually we don""t have direct competitors as the idea is a brand new one. But for sure we have competitors indirectly, those competitors are online websites providing health awareness messages and health advice, and those are around 3 competitors in middle east.
Other competitors are companies providing online marketing services, those companies are a lot, and we are actually different from them as we provide an online marketing using health awareness and by online subscribers which is effective, low cost and of an added value.","Our idea will have a very good impact on our community. The most important benefit that we will act as tool for health care awareness which will really affect the health of our people. Also, people will use our portal to spread health awareness messages, so they will work with us on different initiatives and have a role in changing their communities, which for sure will increase their sense of motivation to work in helping their community.
Our portal will provide a great working opportunity for youth, they can work at home as marketeers, and beside that they are a real change makers. Another benefit, is that we provide a good example of the usage of internet as a work tool not for entertainment, which is a very bad misconception in our Arabic countries.",,"We will use this money to initiate our business, we need this money to work on technical development of the idea which is the core element to initiate our business.","Our idea will work to solve two main problems. First one is the great lack in health care awareness in our Arab world. The second one is the corporate social responsibility which is not used effectively to make a a change in our communities. Concerning health care awareness, the online arabic content is very poor, and the present content is not presented well. Also, till now there is not a good tool for spread of health awareness messages even after the era of social media. Our portal will provide health awareness in a very attractive way, using creative videos, games, info graphics which are produced by specialists in such field, also using our portal system, the awareness message will reach large number of people and make sure that the he or she received and understand the message and able to deliver it to another one. Subscribers in our portal will gain something in return, which is presented in points system which will be exchanged later on by money or any other benefits, all of this will make our message reach accurately to subscribers. 
The second problem we will solve is the need of companies to reach large number of customers easily, this will be provided with our online portal which will have large number of subscribers who will work as marketeers. Also, the companies will efficiently use their social responsibility as a marketing tool with great effect on their community, which is also a big problem we will solve.",,,,,,,"Our business has a great ability to expand. Our portal will expand in two planes, as our customers present in two different planes. First one represents online subscribers, which itself is a powerful tool for sociability, people will have the desire to join our portal as they will gain benefit from it, they can gain money and also work as change makers.
The second plane, is that of companies and NGOs, our business will attract many companies to use our services which will provide a very effective marketing tool, low cost, with large target group, with great effect on community.
In general, the idea will be very attractive for both subscribers and companies as it will provide a good value for them.",,,"The business will gain money as it will provide an online marketing service using health care awareness for companies and NGOs. They will pay for this service and other services we will provide like market analysis.
Also our health awareness products can be sold to interested media and companies which will be a good source for money ",1,NULL,0,0,,,"Concerning demand for our business idea, we did many informal contact with individuals, marketing specialists in pharmaceutical companies, workers in NGOs and entrepreneurs. Our contact was to ask about validity and applicability of the idea, either for subscribers or for companies and NGOs.
The feed back we got was that the idea is applicable and will provide a very good tool for users, and it will need high technical providers with powerful marketing.","Our idea is that we would like to initiate an online portal which will work as a tool for health care awareness in a new and creative way. There is a great lack in Arabic health awareness web content, and most of present content is not presented in an attractive way. This is one side of the idea, the other side is that companies and NGOs must have a role in health care awareness as part of their social responsibility, they usually invest thousands of dollars for their marketing campaign with no benefit on the community they serve, we will provide companies a marketing tool by which they can reach their customers easily, and also affect their lives by spreading the health awareness message. Our online portal will have online subscribers, they will work with us to do a specific task, which will include spreading a message to others using social media, this message will contain two main contents, health awareness message and a marketing message for a specific company or NGO. Subscribers will have something in return according to their level of contribution in the tasks present on the portal. Subscribers will have a great role in their community development, and the companies also will have an easy, more effective and low cost marketing tool with an added value concerning their social responsibility.",,

The camera detects the face and recognizes the person and his state, through the data base of faces and nonverbal communication. It transmits it then to the blind person through a vocal message that mentions the name and the state of the person. The camera can detect as well food and drinks and other products and makes the blind able to distinguish the sort, the date of expiration and the components of food and drink, etc.

Once integrated, they undergo a rigorous monitoring process assessing ongoing key risks, country risk with monthly financial reports & annual due diligence report",,"Similar microfinance platforms are Kiva, Wokai and LendForpeace, but they are non-profit organizations and they allow lending to the micro-entrepreneurs directly through the MFI, solely focused in MENA on Palestine and some cases in Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq. MicroWorld.org, part of the PlaNet Finance Group, is a peer-to-peer platform that was launched 18 months ago in France. It has a similar model to Pi Slice, channeling funds from individual lenders and large companies to MFIs around the world, albeit so far with low penetration in MENA and so far only offering non-remunerated loans for individual lenders. Pi Slice and MicroWorld decided to bring together their experience and resources in the fields of technology, MFIs, and the MENA region to create a partnership that can bring a new form of social action to MENA.
Competitive advantage of Pi Slice: Pi Slice presents a new approach linking MENA MFIs in need of funding to investors wishing to provide finance to MFIs for social reasons. While understanding the concerns of such investors â€“such as transparency, accountability, sustainability, performance, risk, etc.-, along macro MENA drivers and the challenges of MFIs in MENA, Pi Slice achieves the following competitive advantages:
-	Pi Slice has the first-mover advantage;
-	Pi Slice operates in MENA, a market that is under-penetrated and under-funded for the Micro Finance industry that still lacks on regulations and transparency;
-	Pi Slice is an innovative business model supported by tier one strategic partners and a highly motivated and qualified team;
-	Pi Slice will be listing MFIs according to strict selection criteria ensuring transparency, investment and social performance, low risk, sustainability, outreach, etc. MFIs will have more accountability incentives to remain part of the Pi Slice network;
-	Pi Slice will ensure the money to be properly invested to MFIs that in turn lend to their customers, all this supported by the PlanetFinance group of companies;
-	Pi Slice will have its own technology system â€“ developed by MicroWorld.org - that allows users to easily navigate the site, and allows Pi Slice to monitor transactions, traffic, and control fraud;
-	Pi Slice will create a new sustainable and profitable CSR channel for corporations and institutions, and therefore new sources of funding for MFIs through CSR programs and individual investors.
","Driven by social impact, Pi Slice empowers micro-entrepreneurs, who are otherwise excluded from access to credit by formal banking institutions, to start and grow businesses, engage in income-generating activities, and thereby transform their own lives as well as those of others by becoming job creators rather than job seekers. By giving a small online loan, a lender can provide aspiring micro-entrepreneurs with a life-altering opportunity to overcome poverty, enter the formal economy, and proliferate available employment opportunities, thus accelerating development. This would not only enable microfinance institutions (MFIs) to build a sustainable future for the industry, but also help shape the regionâ€™s future economies, communities, and competitiveness.  
In the regionâ€™s development process, the individuals & private sector is now presented with an unparalleled CSR channel to unlock the abilities of millions of unemployed youths, activate human capital in the labor force, and solve economic crises, hence actively contribute to the sustainable development of the MENA region. Today, Pi Slice unveils its MENA portal for individual and corporate investors, opening doors to a brighter future.
",,"1.3 Million Dollars in Funding","Pi Slice will be in the business of assisting and advising Micro Finance Institutions on marketing micro finance schemes. It will operate a platform that allows individuals and businesses to finance projects of micro-entrepreneurs around the world by making loans. 
This advice may include generic advice, a statement, opinion or report. Other services would include:
-	Understanding the budgets and needs of prospective MFIs;
-	Advising MFIs on opportunities;
-	Assisting MFIs in identifying and selecting relevant prospective investors in the target region;
-	Assisting MFIs in organizing product road shows and marketing visits; and
-	Assisting MFIs in maintaining and enhancing their relationships with investors and prospective investors
Pi Slice will effectively be arranging credit for MFIs through approaching corporate investors as well as high net worth individuals. MFIs will remunerate Pi Slice for its services in return in accordance with any fee arrangement. The internet portal for corporate investors and high net worth individuals will include relevant financial and operating information on the MFIs, as well as detailed selection criteria, to facilitate the decisions of Lenders. Once the Lenders decide on which MFI they want to lend to, they can remit the funds directly to the chosen MFI who will then release the funds to their Customers. Loans will have a repayment period of 12 to 24 months. Once loans are repaid to the Lenders, they can decide whether they intend to relend. The interest that is earned by the MFIs on their onward lending to Customers varies depending on the country, and the Lenders will receive a return according to each MFI of their choice. 

",,,,,,,"Pi Slice will achieve its sales targets through a 2-pronged approach:  digital marketing and direct sales. 
Digital Marketing: Pi Slice will use a sophisticated digital marketing strategy which it has developed including social media (Facebook, Twitter), Google ads, PR & media presence, blog & microshows to reach as much as possible Arab internet users. Firstly, it will use SEO and online lead generation techniques to drive potential Lenders to its website. Secondly, it will launch an online marketing campaign on leading regional portals to attract traffic of potential Lenders. This will incorporate a social networking strategy on sites such as LinkedIn, Twitter, Branchout, Facebook targeting professionals, in addition to placing strategic ads on websites that are business & lifestyle orientated such as AME Info, Dubizzle, etc. Finally, it will send out targeted email campaigns to new and existing customers to increase its market share., Pi Slice has partnered up with Xische &Co. (one of its shareholders) to launch together an integrated digital media strategy.
Direct sales / Road show: The major market for Pi Slice will be corporate Lenders through their CSR programs. To attract corporations, Pi Slice will have a dedicated direct sales team to go and build close professional ties with leading companies. Through its business networks as well as attending CSR related events, Pi Slice will secure Lenders and corporate sponsorships.

Once integrated, they undergo a rigorous monitoring process assessing ongoing key risks, country risk with monthly financial reports & annual due diligence report",1,NULL,0,0,,,"The Pi Slice web based platform plugs a long standing need of MFIs to source funds to Customers. It is also difficult for such institutions to provide transparency to the Lenders. Such institutions rely historically in MENA on donations, and donors are not always informed as to where the money is really going. Pi Slice acts as one-point-of-portal broker between Lenders and selected partner MFIs. The Pi Slice web based platform will provide detailed information to Lenders on selected partner MFIs, through their social and investment performance, risk, outreach, transparency, regulation, sustainability, etc. Pi Slice will also follow-up on a regular basis with the MFIs through relationships built with the MFI network.
The parties involved will follow these simple steps:
-	Step 1 â€“ Pi meets the Lender and then refers the Lender to the MFI; 
-	Step 2 â€“ Lender registers and creates an account: create an account by submitting an application  online or by downloading the forms in PDF format and submitting the completed forms to MFI; 
-	Step 3 â€“ Lender activates account: the activation instructions are sent to Lenderâ€™s email address once step 2 (registration) is complete; and
-	Step 4 â€“ Lender confirms identification: Upon activation, Lender will need to send in an ID Confirmation Form.
All the Lenders will follow these simple steps:	
-	Step 1 â€“ Lender views the micro finance projects via the web platform of Pi Slice;  
-	Step 2 â€“ Lender selects a project and gives the money to the MFI; 
-	Step 3 â€“ MFI passes the money to the Customer; and
-	Step 4 â€“ MFI pays the fee to Pi-Slice.
","Pi Slice is a social web based platform â€“ developed in partnership with MicroWorld from the  PlanetFinance Group - promoting social awareness and change. Its framework is a unique connecting system that links individuals and companies wishing to provide finance to MENA based MFIâ€™s, which in turn use the funds to provide micro-credit to their customers. Through this web based platform, motivated individuals and companies can help MFIâ€™s in the MENA region to build a sustainable future for micro-entrepreneurs & a favorable ecosystem for macro development. MicroWorld.org, part of the PlaNet Finance Group, is a peer-to-peer platform that launched 18 months ago in France.
